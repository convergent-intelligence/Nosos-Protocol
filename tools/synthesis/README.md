# Synthesis Tool

Synthesis produces a short, bounded operational report (Water condensation).

It reads the orchestration surfaces and writes a report to `.synthesis/consensus/`.

Usage:

```bash
./scripts/synthesize
./scripts/synthesize --json
```

Outputs:
- `.synthesis/consensus/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
- `.synthesis/correlations/summary.json`
