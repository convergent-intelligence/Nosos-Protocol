# QAI Tools

QAI (quantum-adjacent AI) problems are framed as:
- strict constraints
- measurable progress
- reproducible evidence

This folder starts with a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) lab:
- exact solver (Held-Karp DP) for small n
- heuristic solver (nearest-neighbor + 2-opt)
- verifier (tour validity + length)
