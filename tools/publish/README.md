# Publish Tools

This folder supports the "one post per day" release loop.

Core commands:
- `./scripts/daily` create today's draft (with sources)
- `./scripts/publish` move a draft to posts and update an index

Design:
- evidence-first: drafts include reproducible commands and artifact links
- deterministic layout: predictable paths by date
