# Focus Tool

Focus is a shortcut ritual.

It compresses the current state of the system into one bounded snapshot:
- health
- orchestration field
- budgets
- active and next work

Usage:

```bash
./scripts/focus
./scripts/focus --json
./scripts/focus route
./scripts/focus explain --level 10
```

Writes:
- `.substrate/state/focus.json`
