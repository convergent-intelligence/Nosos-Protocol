# Beryllium Scheme (Be, Z=4): Stable 2x2 Cell

Beryllium is Z=4.

This is the first stable cell topology: a 2x2 lattice.

## The 2x2

Each cell is sovereign in its domain.

## Purpose

Be(4) exists so oxygen does not become fire.
It creates explicit domain boundaries before shared resources accelerate.

## Exit Criteria (Ready For Carbon)

- At least one work item per domain can run in parallel without collisions.
- Cross-domain work is done by missives with capsules.
- Shared resources are protected by leases when edited.
