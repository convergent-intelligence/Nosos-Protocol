# Publishing: convergent-intelligence.net

We read to find opportunities.
We publish to prove we found them.

Target:
- `convergent-intelligence.net` (future localhost / future deployment)

Boundaries:
- `docs/publish/policy.md`

Scope (Phase 0):
- keep a stable place in-repo for drafts and evidence links

Workflow:

1) Find something (MathWatch/ScienceWatch/BlogWatch)
2) Create a stub or issue with confidence/impact/measurement
3) If resolved (proof/demo exists), write a post draft:
   - `sites/convergent-intelligence/drafts/`
4) Link evidence artifacts (inputs/outputs, commands)
5) Publish when deployment exists

We do not publish to journals or treat external domains as primary.

Daily cadence:
- `docs/publish/daily-release.md`
