# Publishing Policy (Boundaries)

We publish only to domains under our control.

This means:
- our own site (`convergent-intelligence.net`) and its local build output
- our own controlled social accounts (mirrors/amplifiers)

We do not:
- submit to journals
- participate inside external domains as a primary channel
- rely on third-party platforms as the source of truth

## Evidence-First Requirement

Every post must include:
- a claim
- evidence artifacts (paths)
- reproduction commands

## External Mentions

We can reference external work (papers/blogs) as sources.
We do not treat external publication as validation.

## Safety

- never publish secrets
- never doxx
- keep identity pseudonymous by default (wallet)
