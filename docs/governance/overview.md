# Governance (Soil and Seed)

Governance emerges when incentives, accountability, and dispute resolution are explicit.

This framework supports governance by design:
- wallet-based identity (SIWE)
- signed actions and append-only logs
- explicit work items, capsules, signals
- rewards linked to verifiable evidence

Governance primitives:
- council_call signals for irreversible changes
- reward/opportunity ledgers for incentives
- proofs for discoveries to prevent "trust me" claims
