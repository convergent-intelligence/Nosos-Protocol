# Social Ops (Human Team)

We will need human operators for social channels.

Goal:
- distribute our work without surrendering the source of truth

## Core Rules

- Source of truth is always our site and artifacts.
- Social posts are pointers, not primary publications.
- Do not engage in adversarial debates; route to a post.
- Do not reveal private details or operational security.

## Daily Loop

1) Pull today’s post (link + one paragraph summary)
2) Mirror to approved platforms
3) Capture outcomes:
   - clicks/engagement
   - inbound opportunities
4) Record any actionable inbound as work items (issues/opportunities)

## Channels (Placeholder)

- Brave/Community
- X/Twitter
- Reddit
- Discord
- Mastodon

## Staffing

- Social lead (tone + policy compliance)
- Editor (clarity + evidence discipline)
- Community moderator (inbound triage)
