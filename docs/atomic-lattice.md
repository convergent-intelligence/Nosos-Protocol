# Atomic Lattice: Numbers vs Grids vs Bonds

You are right to pause here. This is an inflection point.

If we confuse three different ideas, we will mis-allocate domains and collide:

1) Atomic number (Z)
- count of units

2) Lattice size (N x N)
- topology / visibility / coordination surface

3) Valence / bonding
- how many simultaneous relationships can be held stably

These are not the same.

## Atomic Numbers (Z)

Atomic number is just count.

- Carbon is Z=6.
- Oxygen is Z=8.

If you want a strict mapping where "element = number of agents", then element(Z) = Z agents.

## Square Lattice Mapping (N x N)

If you want a strict mapping where "grid size = element", then:

- N x N grid has Z = N^2 units.

Examples:

| Grid | Units | Element (Z) |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1x1  | 1     | Hydrogen (1) |
| 2x2  | 4     | Beryllium (4) |
| 3x3  | 9     | Fluorine (9) |
| 4x4  | 16    | Sulfur (16) |
| 5x5  | 25    | Manganese (25) |
| 6x6  | 36    | Krypton (36) |

Note:
- This is a lattice law, not chemistry.
- It creates "square-number elements". Oxygen (8) is not a square, so it will not appear as a grid size.

## Bond/Valence Mapping (Stability)

Sometimes we choose an element name because it captures stability, not count.

Example:
- Carbon is the backbone of life because it bonds well (stable structure).
- That property can describe a stable coordination core even if the unit count is not 6.

So:
- a 2x2 core can be called "Carbon" because it is the stable backbone (bonding metaphor)
- but it is not "Carbon" by atomic number

## Planck (1)

Planck here is the smallest action unit:
- one lease
- one signal
- one capsule
- one work item transition

If Planck units are correct, large structures can be built safely.

## Default Rule (Strict Periodic Table)

We stay strict to the periodic table for parallel patterns.

Default mapping:
- Z is count (element(Z) = Z units).
- N x N is a lattice choice (topology), and can be used when it helps coordination.
- bonding/valence is stability discipline, not naming.

Implication:
- Do not call a 2x2 lattice "Hydrogen" or "Carbon" by name.
- A 2x2 lattice has 4 units (Z=4).

We can still use compounds (H2O, CO2) as *composition constraints* once the counts exist.
