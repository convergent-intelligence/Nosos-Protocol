# Periodic Table Protocol (Strict)

We stay strict to the periodic table.

Rule:
- element(Z) == Z units.

We use this to search for parallel patterns:
- stability checkpoints (noble gases)
- energetic transitions (iron)
- poetic forms as constraints (sonnet/haiku)

## Core Interpretation

- Units can be agents, roles, or modules, but the count is literal.
- Lattices (N x N) are topologies we may choose; they do not rename Z.
- Compounds (H2O, CO2) are composition constraints (counts of element types) we can enforce when Z is sufficient.

Orthogonal mapping:
- `docs/orthogonal-periodic-table.md` maps Z checkpoints to operational capability.

## Noble Gas Checkpoints (Shell Closure)

Noble gases are stability plateaus.

- Z=2  (He)
- Z=10 (Ne)
- Z=18 (Ar)
- Z=36 (Kr)
- Z=54 (Xe)
- Z=86 (Rn)
- Z=118 (Og)

Protocol at each noble gas:
- freeze schemas (version bump if needed)
- cut a distro (and verify)
- run a drift review (capsule violations, lease violations)
- write a short decision note documenting the new invariant set

## Iron (Z=26)

Iron is a star threshold.

Interpretation:
- up to iron, fusion is energetically favorable (capability compounding feels like it "pays")
- beyond iron, creation is costly (changes must be chosen more carefully)

Protocol at Z=26:
- tighten verification gates
- prioritize stability and memory (audit, restore drills)
- expand governance and safety boundaries

## Poetry as Constraint

Strict forms are where creativity evolves.

Examples:
- Sonnet: 14 lines (Z=14 is Silicon)
- Haiku: 17 syllables (Z=17 is Chlorine)

We do not force the metaphor, but we keep an eye out:
- certain counts may produce unexpectedly stable coordination patterns
