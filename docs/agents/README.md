# Agents

This scaffold supports a four-class agent model for systems work.

The classes are domains of hyperfixation:
- Watcher: system monitoring and observability
- Builder: systems administration and infrastructure
- Guardian: security and secrets
- Scribe: code, documentation, and knowledge systems

These are role boundaries, not personalities.
