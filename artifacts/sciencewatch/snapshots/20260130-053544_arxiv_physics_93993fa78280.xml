      <title>Performance of the Particle-Identification Silicon-Telescope Array Coupled with the VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Particle-Identification Silicon-Telescope Array (PISTA) is a new detection system designed for high-resolution studies of the fission process induced by multi-nucleon transfer in inverse kinematics. It is specifically optimized for experiments with the VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer at GANIL (Grand Acc\'el\'erateur National d'Ions Lourds). The array comprises eight trapezoidal $\Delta$E-E silicon telescopes arranged in a corolla configuration. Each telescope integrates two single-sided stripped silicon detectors, enabling target-like recoil identification, energy loss measurements, and trajectory reconstruction. Positioned in close proximity to the target, PISTA's compact geometry achieves high-efficiency tracking of target-like recoils produced in multi-nucleon transfer reactions at Coulomb barrier energies. The spatial segmentation of the array allows precise determination of the mass and charge of the target-like nucleus, and excitation energy of fissioning systems. This work presents the particle identification and excitation energy reconstruction performances for the interactions of $^{238}$U beam with $^{12}$C target. An excitation energy resolution of 870 keV (FWHM) was determined together with mass resolution of 1.1\% (FWHM). The combination of PISTA and VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer enables unprecedented investigations of the fission process as a function of the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus, particularly for exotic systems produced in transfer-induced reactions.</description>

      <title>From Beam to Bedside: Reinforcing Domestic Supply of $^{99}$Mo/$^{99m}$Tc using Novel High-Current D+ Cyclotrons for Compact Neutron Generation and $^{99}$Mo Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technetium-99m ($^{99m}$Tc) is essential to more than 16 million diagnostic procedures performed annually in the United States. It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns. This work presents the physics motivation, technical design considerations, and projected neutron yields, outlining a pathway from a neutrino-physics prototype to a biomedical isotope production platform.</description>

      <title>A Tolerance-Based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Forecast Validation Using the gamma-Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical field forecast evaluation relies mainly on local scores such as RMSE or MAE. These metrics severely over-penalize small spatial or temporal displacements of coherent structures, a limitation known as the double-penalty issue and common to many forecasting domains. The present paper introduces a tolerance-based framework built on the three-dimensional gamma index, initially designed for medical dose verification, as a unified acceptance criterion for gridded forecasts. The method embeds explicit margins in space (DTA), time (TTA), and intensity (IDT), and evaluates whether predictions agree with observations within predefined physical bounds rather than through pixel-wise differences only. A synthetic illustration is first used to show why conventional metrics can misrepresent usable forecasts. The approach is then applied to satellite-derived SSI fields to demonstrate operational behaviour on a real dataset. Results confirm that the gamma criterion preserves structural consistency under minor positional noise while isolating physically significant discrepancies. The formulation is generic and can be implemented for any gridded variable provided meaningful tolerances are defined, offering a pragmatic complement to existing spatial verification tools in general forecasting workflows.</description>

      <title>StochasticGW-GPU: rapid quasi-particle energies for molecules beyond 10000 atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.</description>

      <title>A joint diffusion approach to multi-modal inference in inertial confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combination of physics-based simulation and experiments has been critical to achieving ignition in inertial confinement fusion (ICF). Simulation and experiment both produce a mixture of scalar and images outputs, however only a subset of simulated data are available experimentally. We introduce a generative framework, called JointDiff, which enables predictions of conditional simulation input and output distributions from partial, multi-modal observations. The model leverages joint diffusion to unify forward surrogate modeling, inverse inference, and output imputation into one architecture. We train our model on a large ensemble of three-dimensional Multi-Rocket Piston simulations and demonstrate high accuracy, statistical robustness, and transferability to experiments performed at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). This work establishes JointDiff as a flexible generative surrogate for multi-modal scientific tasks, with implications for understanding diagnostic constraints, aligning simulation to experiment, and accelerating ICF design.</description>

      <title>Photoionization in KTN deflectors by light in the near-infrared imaging window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optical deflectors (EODs) offer unparalleled scanning speed for laser-scanning microscopy and other applications, but suffer from limited deflection range. EODs based on potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals feature some of the highest number of resolvable spots. These deflectors rely on internal electric fields generated by trapped electrons to enable beam scanning. However, visible light induces rapid photoionization of trapped charges, thus KTN-based deflectors are typically continuously recharged with a bias voltage that effectively limits the range of the deflector. Recent work has proposed the use of KTN-based EODs for biological imaging with infrared excitation light, but quantitative data on near-infrared photoionization is lacking. Here, we present quantitative measurements of photoionization in KTN deflectors across the NIR-I and NIR-IIa biological imaging windows (700 - 1300 nm), a range that is particularly important for deep tissue imaging and nonlinear microscopy. Using a two-beam polarization interferometer, we measured trapped charge density as a function of photon fluence. We observed that the photoionization rate decreases dramatically with increasing wavelength. The charge density decay curves exhibit multi-exponential behavior that cannot be explained by a single-trap model without recapture, indicating the presence of multiple trap species or substantial recapture. These measurements provide critical quantitative guidance for selecting operating wavelengths and charge-scan duty cycles for KTN-based EODs in near-infrared imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing engineering wake models against operational data: insights from the Lillgrund wind farm wake steering campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating engineering wake models under real-world operational conditions is essential for improving wind farm performance predictions. This study uses a unique dataset from the Lillgrund offshore wind farm collected during the Horizon 2020 TotalControl project, combining synchronous SCADA and LiDAR measurements under baseline operation (no intentional yaw offset) and active wake steering. Four analytical wake model combinations are assessed, employing different formulations for velocity deficit, added turbulence, wake superposition, and deflection, implemented in the LongSim software developed by DNV. The analysis focuses on time-averaged wake velocity deficits and turbine- and farm-level power output, with model accuracy quantified using mean absolute error metrics. The models reproduce general wake deficit trends and wake deflection across a range of atmospheric conditions, with normalised velocity deficit errors between 7% and 15%. Power prediction errors increase with farm depth, with turbine-level errors between 3% and 23% and farm-level errors between -13% and +30%. Some analytical models achieve accuracy comparable to reported LES results while requiring substantially lower computational cost. The results highlight the value of field campaigns for benchmarking engineering wake models and inform trade-offs between model fidelity and operational practicality for wake steering applications.</description>

      <title>Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Suspension Balance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Suspension Balance Model (SBM) [J. Fluid Mech. \textbf{275}, 157 (1994)] for two-phase flows uses the momentum balance of the particle phase as a closure for the particle flux, showing that particle migration is driven by the divergence of the particle-phase stress. The underlying basis of this model was challenged by Nott~et~al.\ [Phys. Fluids \textbf{23}, 043304 (2011)] where the authors argued that the hydrodynamic contributions to the suspension stress should not appear in the particle-phase momentum balance, being replaced by a different particle-phase stress. The particle-phase stress proposed by Nott~et~al., while mathematically correct, involves the partitioning of the (non-pairwise-additive) hydrodynamic forces, and care is needed to understand how the force on a chosen particle is affected by a second particle. We show by a simple two-particle calculation what is the proper partitioning, and show that it is consistent thermodynamically and gives the correct equilibrium osmotic pressure of Brownian colloids. Using Stokesian Dyanmics suspension rheology, we quantitatively demonstrate that the hydrodynamic contribution to the suspension stress is virtually identical to particle-phase stress; the only difference is that the isolated single-particle hydrodynamic stress contribution -- the Einstein viscosity correction -- must be removed from the suspension stress when used to predict particle flux. Our results validate a key assumption of the SBM and therefore revive its physical foundation.</description>

      <title>Trapping and cooling mechanisms in blue-detuned magneto-optical traps of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In red-detuned magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of molecules, sub-Doppler heating competes with Doppler cooling, resulting in high temperature and low density. A solution is offered by the blue-detuned MOT where sub-Doppler cooling dominates and the cloud is compressed. Several blue-detuned molecular MOTs have been implemented. A recent implementation relies on a pair of orthogonally polarized components whose frequency separation is smaller than the transition linewidth. We identify the trapping force in these MOTs. At a certain magnetic field, there is a state that is dark to the laser propagating in one direction, but not to the counter-propagating one. This Zeeman-induced dark state (ZIDS) sets up an imbalance in the photon scattering rate, leading to a restoring force. We also study the role of the moving lattices generated by the closely-spaced frequency components of the light. We show that there is a velocity-dependent force that drives the molecules towards the speeds of these moving lattices, and that over a relevant range of magnetic fields this combines with the ZIDS force to transport molecules towards the centre of the MOT. Here, gray molasses cooling, assisted by non-adiabatic transitions driven by the time-varying polarization of the light field, cools the molecules towards zero velocity. We study these mechanisms for model systems with simple level structures, then extend them to molecules with ground state hyperfine structure.</description>

      <title>Accurate Thermophysical Properties of Water using Machine-Learned Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme for hydrodynamic phonon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for hydrodynamic phonon transport in solid materials based on the Boltzmann transport equation under the double relaxation time approximation, in which both the normal and resistive scattering processes are accounted. The trapezoidal and midpoint rules are adopted for the temporal integration of the scattering and migration terms under the framework of finite volume method, respectively. Instead of direct numerical interpolation, the kinetic equation is solved again when reconstructing the interfacial flux, in order to realize the coupling of phonon migration and scattering within a numerical time step. Specifically, the finite difference scheme is introduced and the second-order upwind or central schemes are used for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function and its spatial gradient. Consequently, the cell size and time step of the present method could be larger than the phonon mean free path and relaxation time in the limit of small Knudsen numbers. Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can accurately capture multi-scale thermal conduction phenomena within different normal or resistive scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Depth-Aware Machine Learning Framework for Bubble Characterization in Two-Phase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the three-dimensional motion of bubbles is essential for interpreting transport and mixing in multiphase flows, especially when bubbles deform under shear or move rapidly through the flow field. In many laboratory setups, only a single high-speed camera is available, which limits measurements to two dimensions. Traditional image-processing tools can identify bubbles only when they appear circular and isolated, but they struggle with irregularly shaped bubbles, shear-induced deformations, strong blurring, and partial overlaps. Multi-camera systems could overcome these issues, but require significant hardware additions and calibration effort. In this work, we introduce a new machine-learning framework that can detect bubbles and estimate their depth using only a single 20 kHz high-speed camera with 3 \textmu m resolution. The method first uses a large unlabeled dataset and clusters the bubbles with an unsupervised algorithm to reveal their underlying structure. These clusters provide pseudo labels, which are combined with a small set of true in-plane bubble labels to train a semi-supervised model that generalizes across different bubble appearances. These components produce a continuous depth-proxy score that indicates how close each bubble is to the imaging plane, even when bubbles are distorted or irregularly shaped. In parallel, we perform robust bubble identification using instance segmentation, which separates touching, overlapping, and elongated bubbles generated by high-velocity shear. Quantitatively, the in-plane segmentation baseline achieves strong held-out performance with Average Precision (AP) = 0.818, implying stable detection across thresholds, clutter, bubble detection Precision of 0.901, and a False-Positive Rate (FPR) near 6.1\%, hence low spurious bubbles and cleaner statistics under the tested acquisition conditions.</description>

      <title>Multiple binding modes of AKT on PIP$_3$-containing membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is triggered by recruitment of AKT to cellular membranes. Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Framework for Neural Network Quantum States in Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization of Neural Network Quantum States (NQS) in discrete Fock spaces is limited by sampling variance and slow mixing. We present a deterministic framework that optimizes a neural backflow ansatz within dynamically adaptive configuration subspaces, corrected by second-order perturbation theory. This approach eliminates Monte Carlo noise and, through a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, exhibits sub-linear scaling with respect to subspace size. Benchmarks on bond dissociation in H2O and N2, and the strongly correlated chromium dimer Cr2, validate the method's accuracy and stability in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-selective nonlinear wavefront control in resonant thin-film lithium niobate metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact control over frequency conversion and wavefront shaping. However, existing approaches, often based on geometric phase, lack wavelength selectivity, resulting in static nonlinear responses. Here, we demonstrate a thin-film lithium niobate metasurface that enables spectrally selective shaping of second-harmonic generation through resonance-engineered phase control. The structure consists of two regions with distinct phase responses, realized via spectral tuning of Mie-type resonances. This design enables simultaneous frequency conversion and spatial mode shaping, transforming a Gaussian pump near 1100 nm into a first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode at 550 nm, while maintaining the pump profile. The demonstrated approach offers a pathway toward ultracompact and tunable components for nonlinear holography and related applications.</description>

      <title>Shaping the learning signal in a combined Q-learning rule to improve structured cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-learning provides a standard reinforcement learning framework for studying cooperation by specifying how agents update action values from repeated local interactions outcomes. Although previous work has shown that reputation can promote cooperation in such systems, most models introduce reputation by modifying payoffs, encoding it directly in the state or changing partner selection, which makes it difficult to isolate the role of the learning signal itself. Here, we construct the reinforcement signal as a weighted combination of reputation and game payoffs, leaving the game and network structure unchanged. We find that increasing the weight on reputation generally promotes cooperation by consolidating clusters, but this effect is conditional on the learning dynamics. Specifically, this promoting effect vanishes in two regimes: when the learning rate is extremely small, which prevents effective information propagation and when the discount factor approaches one, as distant future expectations obscure the immediate reputational advantage. Outside these limiting cases, the efficacy of reputation in promoting cooperation is attenuated by higher learning rates but amplified by larger discount factors. These results advance the understanding of cooperative dynamics by demonstrating that cooperation can be stabilized through the reputational shaping of learning signals alone, providing critical insights into the interplay between social information and individual learning parameters.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric velocity boundary conditions lead to zonal flow in centrifugal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating annular centrifugal convection to investigate how mixed (asymmetric) velocity boundary conditions and geometric curvature shape the flow organisation and heat transfer. Motivated by the quasi-two-dimensionalisation under strong rotation and the long spin-up required for large-scale states, we employ two-dimensional simulations and consider four boundary-condition sets: no-slip/no-slip (INON), no-slip/stress-free (INOS), stress-free/no-slip (ISON) and stress-free/stress-free (ISOS). For fixed geometry with the radius ratio $\eta=0.5$ and over the Rayleigh number $Ra\in[10^6,10^9]$, the heat transfer is strongest for ISOS, followed by INOS and INON, while ISON exhibits a pronounced suppression as a strong zonal flow aligned with the rotation develops. In the three cases dominated by large-scale circulation, the Nusselt number $Nu$ follows an effective classical-type scaling close to $Nu\sim Ra^{0.27}$, whereas the zonal-flow branch displays a much weaker scaling $Nu\sim Ra^{0.1}$ and strong flow anisotropy with the large difference between the radial and azimuthal Reynolds numbers $Re_r\ll Re_\varphi$. A dissipation analysis shows that zonal-flow formation is accompanied by a transition from boundary-layer-dominated dissipation to a relatively low and uniform bulk dissipation, consistent with shear-induced plume suppression. By varying the radius ratio $\eta$, we demonstrate that increasing $\eta$ weakens curvature asymmetry and destabilises the zonal-flow state, leading to roll-dominated convection in the planar limit, and we relate the accompanying bulk-temperature asymmetry to the boundary heat flux asymmetry using a free-convective boundary-layer model.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Barium Titanate Waveguide Designs For Efficient Nonlinear Frequency Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is emerging as a powerful integrated photonic material, combining strong $X^{(2)}$ and electro-optic nonlinearities with rapidly improving thin-film waveguide quality. Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable. These results position hybrid BaTiO$_3$-TiO$_2$ waveguides as a practical route to CMOS-compatible, high-efficiency $X^{(2)}$ devices for integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Optically reconfigurable canalization of exciton-polaritons in a non-hyperbolic perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Measurement of stray light in the LISA instrument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of stray light in a complex optical system can be a complex task. We developed a method to measure coherent stray light inside an assembled device, determining all stray light sources and their relative contribution. The method is based on the insertion of a laser with a scanned frequency and the detection of all the electrical and optical signals obtained from the instrument. The spectra calculated from these signals show fringes due to interference between each stray light contribution and the nominal beam. The frequency of these interference peaks indicates the difference in path length between the stray light path and the nominal path.  To have a description of the measured data we realized optical simulations, which link the measured path length to a possible path throughout the system. In the following, we will show some measurements made on a test bench realized to simulate the performance of LISA interferometers and describe how accurate simulations are in predicting and explaining the measured results.</description>

      <title>PINN-based short-term forecasting of fault slip evolution during the 2010 slow slip event in the Bungo Channel, Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring and forecasting fault slip evolution are fundamental for understanding earthquake cycles and assessing future seismic hazards. This study proposes a physics-based data assimilation framework that integrates geodetic observations with fault mechanics introducing spatial heterogeneity in frictional properties, with a particular focus on short-term fault slip forecasting. The proposed method employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to calculate fault slip evolutions and to optimize the spatial distribution of frictional properties and is applied to the 2010 slow slip event beneath the Bungo Channel, southwest Japan, by changing the data period to be assimilated. When only the initial phase of slip acceleration is assimilated, a velocity-weakening frictional region is inferred beneath southwest Shikoku, corresponding to the initial nucleation are of the slow slip event. Out results demonstrate that the PINN-based data assimilation framework successfully forecasts slow transient slip even when only slip acceleration data are assimilated, whereas forecasts based on frictionally homogeneous models result in unstable fast slip. This difference can be interpreted as a consequence of introducing frictional heterogeneity, which allows both the characteristic size of the slipping region and the critical nucleation size to be variable, leading to stable slip evolution consistent with observations. When longer observation periods are assimilated, a velocity-strengthening region emerges around the slip-weakening patch, progressively restricting the direction of slip propagation. This velocity-strengthening region is interpreted as a mechanical constraint imposed by fault physics, linking the slip regions required to reproduce the observed geodetic time series. The results highlight the capability of PINN-based data assimilation incorporating geodetic observations and fault mechanics.</description>

      <title>Non-secular polariton leakage and dark-state protection in hybrid plasmonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.</description>

      <title>Fewest-Switches Surface Hopping with Combined Deep Learning Potential and Long Short-Term Memory Network Propagator for Simulating Realistic Photochemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) is the most popular method for simulating photochemical processes of molecular systems. Recently, we have constructed long short-term memory (LSTM) networks as a propagator for electronic subsystems in FSSH dynamics simulations. The collective results on Tully's three models have been reproduced satisfactorily. In the present work, we develop an extended LSTM-FSSH framework to simulate realistic photochemical reactions. The input features of LSTM as well as the training procedure are redesigned to represent high-dimensional nuclear degrees of freedom in an effective way. Equivariant neural networks are integrated with LSTM to build adiabatic potential energy surfaces in ground and excited states. Photoisomerizations of $\mathrm{CH_2NH}$ and azobenzene are simulated, showing that our new proposed LSTM-FSSH method can produce excited-state lifetimes and product yields accurately in comparison with conventional FSSH simulations as reference. Only 10 reference trajectories are required for training LSTM networks, and then a trajectory ensemble can be generated with very efficient LSTM-FSSH dynamics simulations to obtain collective results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the connection between photonic band-gap formation in two types of two-dimensional photonic crystals and the emergence of reverse electromagnetic energy flows generated by linearly polarized plane waves incident on a photonic-crystal slab. We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission.</description>

      <title>Third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the applicability of the core-polarization-corrected Dirac--Fock method, formulated within the framework of the local Dirac--Hartree--Fock (LDF) potential, for the accurate determination of static scalar and tensor electric dipole polarizabilities. This work presents theoretical values of blackbody-radiation-induced Stark shifts of atomic energy levels. The Dirac--Fock method augmented by core-polarization corrections is employed not only to evaluate these shifts but also to compute the Bethe logarithm for alkali-metal atoms. The results are critically compared with data available in the contemporary literature, and the strengths and limitations of the present approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>A costing framework for fusion power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper summarizes and consolidates fusion power-plant costing work performed in support of ARPA-E from 2017 through 2024, and documents the evolution of the associated analysis framework from early capital-cost-focused studies to a standards-aligned, auditable costing capability. Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE.</description>

      <title>Impact of behavioral heterogeneity on epidemic outcome and its mapping into effective network topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human behavior plays a critical role in shaping epidemic trajectories. During health crises, people respond in diverse ways in terms of self-protection and adherence to recommended measures, largely reflecting differences in how individuals assess risk. This behavioral variability induces effective heterogeneity into key epidemic parameters, such as infectivity and susceptibility. We introduce a minimal extension of the susceptible-infected-removed~(SIR) model, denoted HeSIR, that captures these effects through a simple bimodal scheme, where individuals may have higher or lower transmission--related traits. We derive a closed-form expression for the epidemic threshold in terms of the model parameters, and the network's degree distribution and homophily, defined as the tendency of like--risk individuals to preferentially interact. We identify a resurgence regime just beyond the classical threshold, where the number of infected individuals may initially decline before surging into large-scale transmission. Through simulations on homogeneous and heterogeneous network topologies we corroborate the analytical results and highlight how variations in susceptibility and infectivity influence the epidemic dynamics. We further show that, under suitable assumptions, the HeSIR model maps onto a standard SIR process on an appropriately modified contact network, providing a unified interpretation in terms of structural connectivity. Our findings quantify the effect of heterogeneous behavioral responses, especially in the presence of homophily, and caution against underestimating epidemic potential in fragmented populations, which may undermine timely containment efforts. The results also extend to heterogeneity arising from biological or other non-behavioral sources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Aerodynamic Response and an Equivalent Static Wind-resistant Design for Anticlastic Conical Tensile Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical Tensile Membrane Structure (TMS) is commonly used for aesthetics, economic design, high rain and snow loading. Such TMS shows complex aerodynamic behavior in presence of geometric nonlinearity, not adequately studied in the past. The aerodynamic responses of anticlastic conical TMS under random wind loading is presented herein along with an equivalent static wind resistant design approach. The stochastic wind loading on the TMS in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is simulated via the Large Eddy simulation (LES); which is detailed in a previous study by the authors and hence not repeated here. The aerodynamic loading is then employed as input in conducting the nonlinear time history analyses considering open (i.e. without facade) and closed (with facade) TMS, supported by peripheral/radial cables. The influence of the key parameters (aerodynamic roughness height, the rise-span ratio of the TMS and the membrane prestress, notably) are demonstrated. Although increasing prestress and rise-to-span ratio enhances the stiffness of TMS, the former shows dominance. Increasing roughness height also lead to increased peak loading/responses by enhanced turbulence. An equivalent static wind-resistant design is presented via the Gust Response Factors (GRFs) and an additional Nonlinear Adjustment Factors (NAFs). These factors are presented systematically, encompassing alternative scenarios. Multi-linear regression models are presented for predictive modeling of these factors, along with a probabilistic analysis for their design values that can be employed in practice bypassing an involved nonlinear dynamic analysis.</description>

      <title>Statistics and systematics of electron EDM searches with BaF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NL-$e$EDM experiment searches for a non-zero electric dipole moment of the electron $d_e$ ($e$EDM) in the ground state of barium monofluoride (BaF). A beam of BaF from a supersonic expansion source is probed with the spin precession method presented in \cite{Boeschoten2024}. This method permits the extraction of an $e$EDM value as well as values for parameters causing a possible systematic bias leading to a false $e$EDM. The currently achievable sensitivity is limited by statistics collected in a period of 34 hours and yields an $d_e$ of $2(3) \times 10^{-25}$ $e\,$cm. Furthermore, from the same dataset sufficiently strong limits on parameters which can induce a false $e$EDM are extracted. These are mainly the electric field \textbf{E} and the intensity of the lasers fields in the fiducial volume of the experiment. We summarize the steps required to upgrade of the experiment to reach a competitive level on $d_e$, e.g. an intense laser-cooled beam from a cryogenic buffer gas source and the light collection efficiency of fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Measuring node similarity using minimum cycles in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycles are ubiquitous in various networks such as social, biological, and technological systems, where they play a significant functional and dynamical role. This paper proposes a node similarity measure based on minimal simple cycles, referred to as cycle similarity. Specifically, the metric quantifies the similarity between two nodes by considering the minimal cycles that connect them through their neighboring nodes, with an upper bound imposed on the cycle size to ensure computational feasibility. We then systematically examine the effectiveness and applicability of this similarity measure through two fundamental tasks: link prediction and community detection. To address the scarcity of cycles in link prediction, an edge-addition correction strategy is introduced, whereby the existence of a candidate edge is hypothetically assumed before computing node similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that this correction leads to improved performance on datasets including karate, INT, PPI, and Grid. In hierarchical community detection using cycle similarity, we find that the significance of cyclic structures (reflected by Z-scores), the presence of pendant nodes with degree one, and the existence of cut vertices are the primary factors influencing the algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. IV couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach to incorporating coupling elements into a generalized coupled mode theory is presented. The simplest model of coupling of a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines was used. Even such a simple model significantly complicated the system of coupled equations. It turned into a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. Since the integral kernels are degenerate, this system is reduced to three independent systems of differential equations. Instead of solving a system of coupled integro-differential equations, we need to find solutions to three systems of ordinary differential equations. Two systems describe the distribution of the field excited by one loop and the specified value of the excitation current in it. In the first system the loop is located at the section's input, and in the second, at the section's output. The third system does not depend on the loop parameters at all. It describes the distribution of the field excited by an electron beam in a section without loops. Based on the developed analytical model, the computer code was developed for matching the loop couplers for the uniform accelerating sections of X-band. The calculation results were used to simulate the non-uniform section. Without additional matching, we obtained an input reflection coefficient of 8E-3.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of high-order harmonic radiation enhanced by XUV-driven electron-hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of high-order harmonic radiation with photon energies extending beyond the regular cutoff energy in standard high-order harmonic generation. The extension of the regular harmonic cutoff results from infrared (IR)-driven recombination of valence photoelectrons into a cationic core hole created by extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) excitation of inner-shell electrons into the transient valence hole in a combined XUV+IR configuration [Buth et al., Opt. Lett. 36, 3530 (2011)]. We show that the microscopic dipole phase at the extended harmonic frequencies is sensitive to the relative IR-XUV delay and IR intensity, whereas the corresponding signal intensity drops significantly for chirped XUV pulses with poor temporal coherence. We discuss the impact of such sensitivity on the macroscopic harmonic radiation, whereby decoherence among the dipole emitters may lead to further signal suppression.</description>

      <title>Initial observations in X-point target divertor discharges on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first high-power (&gt; 3 MW) H-mode experiments using a double-null X-point-target (XPT) divertor configuration have been performed on MAST-U. The XPT geometry is obtained by combining a large strike point radius, similar to the Super-X divertor (SXD), with an additional X-point near the separatrix in the baffled outer divertor chambers and leads to additional exhaust benefits over the SXD. The broader electron density profile near the secondary X-point leads to additional plasma-neutral interactions, evidenced by a broader hydrogenic emission profile, and resulting in larger power and ion sinks. The increase in plasma-neutral interactions also leads to lower target electron temperatures and heat fluxes. These benefits appear to extend to transients, and preliminary evidence of improved ELM buffering in the XPT is presented. These results showcase how multiple alternative divertor configuration strategies can be combined to improve momentum, power, and particle losses, which may be required for the challenging exhaust conditions of future reactors.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Human-Like Mechanics Intuition from Scarce Observations via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can infer accurate mechanical outcomes from only a few observations, a capability known as mechanics intuition. The mechanisms behind such data-efficient learning remain unclear. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework in which an agent encodes continuous physical observation parameters into its state and is trained via episodic switching across closely related observations. With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate. We explain this generalization through a unified theoretical view: it emerges when the learned value function enforces Bellman consistency across neighboring task parameters, rendering the Bellman residual stationary with respect to physical variations. This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks. Our work establishes episodic switching as a principled route to artificial mechanics intuition and offers a theoretical link to similar generalization abilities in biological learners.</description>

      <title>Reddy: An open-source toolbox for analyzing eddy-covariance measurements in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land-atmosphere exchange processes are determined by turbulent fluxes, which can be derived from eddy-covariance measurements. This method was established to quantify ecosystem-scale vertical atmosphere-vegetation exchange processes, but is also used to validate atmospheric turbulence theories with the ultimate aim to improve the representation of turbulence in numerical models. While the focus has long been on turbulence over idealized, homogeneous and flat surfaces, recent scientific developments are shifting towards investigating turbulent exchange processes in complex heterogeneous environments under non-idealized conditions, which pose particular challenges, e.g. advective fluxes between different surface types or non-stationarity of nighttime turbulence. This requires to rethink standard post-processing routines for determining turbulent fluxes from the high-frequency sonic and gas analyzer measurements. Here, we introduce the open-source R-package 'Reddy', which provides modular-built functions for post-processing, analysis and visualization of eddy-covariance measurements, including investigating spectra, coherent structures, anisotropy, flux footprints and surface energy balance closure. The 'Reddy' package is accompanied by a detailed documentation and a set of jupyter notebooks introducing new users hands-on to eddy-covariance data analysis. We showcase 'Reddy' based on measurements from three different sites in Norway: A case study during strong stratification over alpine tundra, for determining suitable averaging times during ice-cover transition at a boreal lake, and for fitting flux-variance relations for a permafrost peatland. 'Reddy' serves as extension of previously developed software packages, paving the way towards holistic turbulence data analysis in heterogeneous real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Mode Switching Through Exceptional Points Induced by Lasing-Inversion Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gain-loss coupling in optical cavities induces exceptional points (EPs), where two optical modes coalesce. The large modal overlap near an EP intensifies gain competition, favoring single-mode lasing. Recent studies further revealed self-modulation closer to the EP that transforms the lasing mode into a frequency comb. Such EP-enabled comb formation suggests a previously unaccounted-for mechanism that overcomes the strong gain competition and drives a second mode to threshold. Here, using a Bloch coupled-mode theory derived from first principles, we show that the second threshold arises from dynamical couplings among the population inversion, the lasing field, and a dark cavity mode. The lasing-inversion coupling produces extra EPs, whose spectral structure governs switching among single-mode lasing and frequency combs with different repetition rates. This above-threshold mode-switching mechanism enables new opportunities for tunable photonic systems, including adaptive optical communication links and dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Rapid estimation of global sea surface temperatures from sparse streaming in situ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) from staggered SST measurements is essential for weather forecasting and climate projections. However, when SST measurements are sparse, the resulting inferred SST fields are rather inaccurate. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) to reconstruct the high-resolution SST field from sparse in situ observations, without using a model. The S-DEIM estimate consists of two terms, one computed from instantaneous in situ observations using empirical interpolation, and the other learned from the historical time series of observations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We train the RNNs using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weekly high-resolution SST dataset spanning the years 1989-2021 which constitutes the training data. Subsequently, we examine the performance of S-DEIM on the test data, comprising January 2022 to January 2023. For this test data, S-DEIM infers the high-resolution SST from 100 in situ observations, constituting only 0.2% of the high-resolution spatial grid. We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\pm 1^\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time.</description>

      <title>Excited-State Intermolecular Proton Transfer and Competing Pathways in 3-Hydroxychromone: A Non-adiabatic Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) is a fundamental photochemical process in which photoexcitation induces proton transfer within a molecule, leading to the formation of a tautomeric excited state. It was observed experimentally that the 3-hydroxychromone (3-HC) system exhibits two distinct proton-transfer time scales upon excitation to the lowest "bright" singlet excited state: an ultrafast component on the femtosecond time scale and a slower one on the picosecond time scale, largely insensitive to solvent effects. Up to now, the microscopic origin of the second time constant has only been hypothesised. Here, using mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we explicitly observe the two ESIPT time constants and we rationalise the origin of the second time scale by the presence of a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion. Comprehensive analysis of the excited-state potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic trajectories enables us to construct an explicit reaction network for 3-HC, delineating the interplay between canonical ESIPT and torsion-mediated pathways. This unified mechanistic framework reconciles the coexistence of ultrafast and slower ESIPT components, offering new insights into the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Broadband Second Harmonic Generation using Fixed-Period Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is a widely used nonlinear optical device for second harmonic generation (SHG). Despite its wide adoption in commercial systems, its bandwidth for SHG is fundamentally limited by the quasi-phase matching condition. This can be overcome by aperiodic or chirped PPLN structures; however, such devices are typically custom-fabricated and not readily available commercially. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach to achieving broadband SHG by using a standard PPLN crystal containing multiple fixed poling periods. Broadband operation is realized by angle tuning the crystal relative to input beam in free-space. The effect of angle tuning is examined over a range of incident angles, and an 1.6x enhancement in SHG bandwidth is demonstrated. These results suggest a practical and efficient strategy for broadband SHG using standard PPLN devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of wake dynamics behind hydrofoils is critical for mitigating vortex-induced vibrations and improving the performance of hydraulic machinery. Conventional turbulence modeling approaches often struggle to capture the unsteady, coherent structures governing wake behavior, particularly for slender hydrofoils operating at high Reynolds numbers. This study addresses this limitation by combining scale-resolving numerical simulations, including high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation (LES), with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to investigate the turbulent wake of a symmetric, blunt trailing-edge hydrofoil operating at zero angle of attack. The flow was analyzed at a Reynolds number of approximately 7.5x10e5, i.e. close to the onset of wake-structure interaction effects. LES was performed using a fine mesh of approximately 500 million nodes to resolve near-wall and wake dynamics beyond the experimental field of view, while PIV measurements provided time-resolved velocity fields downstream of the trailing edge. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to the PIV data to extract dominant coherent structures and quantify their contribution to the turbulent kinetic energy. POD analysis reveals that energy is distributed across many modes, with the leading mode capturing the primary wake dynamics and higher modes forming coupled oscillatory pairs associated with von Karman vortex shedding. PIV-LES agreement shows that central wake measurements combined with numerical simulations enables full wake reconstruction and validates modeling for vibration-relevant hydrofoil dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coherent vibrational dynamics in molecular bond breaking: methyl radical umbrella mode probed by femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of coherent molecular vibrations launched by the breaking of a molecular bond. The methyl radical, which is produced by $267\,\mathrm{nm}$ photodissociation of methyl iodide, is excited to high levels in its $\nu_2$ ``umbrella" vibrational mode by the dissociation. The ensuing coherent vibrational dynamics are observed by measuring ultrafast time-dependent changes in the x-ray transition energy from the C$1s$ to the singly-occupied valence orbital. Due to symmetry, the real space vibrational motion appears predominantly in the x-ray energy shift at the difference frequencies of the $\nu_2$ progression, although the fundamental frequencies of the $\nu_2$ mode are also observed. By constructing a fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics the coherent superposition is rigorously characterized and the real-space motion of the radicals is reconstructed. The retrieved trajectories are dominated by pronounced quantum beating governed by the high degree of coherent excitation and the strong negative anharmonicity of the $\nu_2$ mode.</description>

      <title>Exact coherent structures as building blocks of turbulence on large domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact unstable solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are thought to underpin the dynamics of turbulence, but are usually computed in minimal computational domains. Here, we extend this dynamical systems approach to spatially extended turbulent flows featuring multiple interacting 'substructures', and show how new simple invariant solutions can be constructed by spatial tiling of exact solutions from small-box calculations. Candidate solutions are found via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function which targets autorecurrence in spatially-masked regions of the flow. We apply these ideas to a vertically-extended Kolmogorov flow, where we first identify large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) which are combinations of high-dissipation, small-box solutions with laminar patches. We then show that vertically-stacked combinations of pairs of distinct small-box RPOs can form robust guesses for dynamically-relevant two-tori in the larger domain. Finally, we show how our optimization procedure can identify 'turbulent' trajectories which locally shadow a small-box RPO for multiple periods in a subdomain. These small-box combinations are possible as the flow spends prolonged periods in a regime where it can be effectively considered as a pair of weakly-coupled small-box systems, due to shielding effects associated with higher-dissipation flow structures.</description>

      <title>Post-Disaster Resource Redistribution and Cooperation Evolution Based on Two-Layer Network Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the aftermath of large-scale disasters, the scarcity of resources and the paralysis of infrastructure raise severe challenges to effective post-disaster recovery. Efficient coordination between shelters and victims plays a crucial role in building community resilience, yet the evolution of two-layer behavioral feedback between these two groups through network coupling remains insufficiently understood. Here, this study develops a two-layer network to capture the cross-layer coupling between shelters and victims. The upper layer uses a post-disaster emergency resource redistribution model within the framework of the public goods game, while the lower layer adopts a cooperative evolutionary game to describe internal victim interactions. Monte Carlo simulations on scale-free networks reveal threshold effects of incentives: moderate public goods enhancement and subsidies promote cooperation, whereas excessive incentives induce free-riding. In contrast, credible and well-executed punishment effectively suppresses defection. Targeted punishment of highly connected shelters significantly enhances cooperation under resource constraints. A comparative analysis using a network generated from the actual coordinates of Beijing shelters confirms the model's generality and practical applicability. The findings highlight the importance of calibrated incentives, enforceable sanctions, and structural targeting in fostering robust cooperation across organizational and individual levels in post-disaster environments.</description>

      <title>Molecular structure, binding, and disorder in TDBC-Ag plexcitonic assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plexcitonic assemblies are hybrid materials composed of a plasmonic nanoparticle and molecular or semiconducting emitters whose electronic transitions are strongly coupled to the plasmonic mode. This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Nanopore Wall Geometry on Electrical Double-Layer Charging Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement strongly influences electrochemical systems, where structural control has enabled advances in nanofluidics, sensing, and energy storage. In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or supercapacitors, energy density is governed by the accessible surface area of porous electrodes. Continuum models, built on first-principles transport equations, have provided critical insight into electrolyte dynamics under confinement but have largely focused on pores with straight walls. In such geometries, a fundamental trade-off emerges: wider pores charge faster but store less energy, while narrower pores store more charge but charge slowly. Here, we apply perturbation analysis to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a single pore of gradually varying radius, focusing on the small potential and slender aspect ratio regime. Our analysis reveals that sloped pore walls induce an additional ionic flux, enabling simultaneous acceleration of charging and enhancement of charge storage. The theoretical predictions closely agree with direct numerical simulations while reducing computational cost by 5-6 orders of magnitude. We further propose a modified effective circuit representation that captures geometric variation along the pore and demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into pore-network models. This work establishes a scalable approach to link pore geometry with double-layer dynamics and offers new design principles for optimizing supercapacitor performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful medical imaging technique, but the design and evaluation of new PET scanner technologies present significant challenges. The process is typically divided into three major stages: 1. detector design and simulation, 2. image reconstruction, and 3. image interpretation. Each of these stages requires significant expertise, making it difficult for individuals or small teams to manage all three at once. AIRPET (AI-driven Revolution in Positron Emission Tomography) is a web-based platform designed to address this challenge by integrating all phases of PET design into a single, accessible, and AI-assisted workflow. AIRPET provides an interface to large language models (LLMs) for assisted geometry creation and an interface for basic PET image reconstruction with the potential for further expansion. Here we introduce AIRPET and outline its current functionality and proposed additions.</description>

      <title>Learning Transient Convective Heat Transfer with Geometry Aware World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) simulations are fundamental to engineering and physics but are often computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Urban Patterns-of-Life Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding urban mobility requires models that capture how people interact with and navigate the built environment. We present a scalable, generalizable agent-based framework in which daily schedules emerge from the interplay between mandatory (e.g., work, school) and flexible (e.g., errands, food, leisure) activities, driven by evolving individual needs. The results of our model are validated against empirical patterns from the 2017 U.S. National Household Travel Survey, including activity distributions, origin-destination flows, and trip-chain length distributions. We introduce a normalized similarity metric to quantify agreement between simulated and empirical patterns. Most cities achieve scores above 0.80, demonstrating strong alignment without the need for city-specific calibration. The model scales efficiently to over 20 million agents, enabling full-population simulations of large metropolitan areas. This combination of universality and scalability enables scenario analysis for infrastructure stress testing, disaster recovery, innovation diffusion, and disease spread in urban systems.</description>

      <title>Putting Pressure Under Pressure: On the Status of Classical Pressure in Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the century-old debate surrounding the status of thermodynamics in relativity has centered on the search for a suitably relativistic temperature; recent works by Chua (2023) and Chua and Callender (forthcoming) have suggested that the classical temperature concept -- consilient as it is in classical settings -- 'falls apart' in relativity. However, these discussions typically assume an unproblematic Lorentz transformation for -- specifically, the Lorentz invariance of -- the pressure concept. Here I argue that, just like the classical temperature, the classical concept of pressure breaks down in relativistic settings. I discuss how this might suggest a new thermodynamic limit -- a u --&gt; 0 limit -- without which an unambiguous thermodynamic description of systems doesn't emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01720v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate background-free, hyperfine-level-selective measurements of individual Cs atoms by simultaneous cooling to $5.3~\mu\rm K$ and imaging on the $6s_{1/2}\rightarrow 5d_{5/2}$ electric-quadrupole transition. We achieve hyperfine resolved detection with fidelity 0.9993(4) and atom retention of 0.9954(5), limited primarily by vacuum lifetime. Performing state measurements in a 3D cooling configuration enables repeated low loss measurements. A theoretical analysis of an extension of the demonstrated approach based on quenching of the excited state with an auxiliary field, identifies parameters for hyperfine-resolved measurements with a projected fidelity of $\sim 0.9995 $ in $\sim 60~\mu\rm s$.</description>

      <title>Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08533v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric and fast Rydberg gate protocol for long range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a new Rydberg gate design based on the original $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ protocol [Jaksch, et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2\pi$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Conditional Denoising Model as a Physical Surrogate Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inorganic Electrides Discovery by Generative Models and Hierarchical Screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.</description>

      <title>The First Quantitative Study of Tail Regrowth of CME-Driven Disconnection in Comet C/2023 P1 Nishimura</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) was observed by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), onboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, from 2023 September 1 to 14. During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\sim$86$\pm7~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\sim$295$\pm20~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.</description>

      <title>A levitated nano-accelerometer sensitized by quantum quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a nanoscale accelerometer exploiting the nonequilibrium dynamics of a nanoparticle near the quantum ground state. We explore the dynamics after quenching the trapping potential and find that rapid quenching provides an instance at which the sensitivity is enhanced due to the minimized uncertainty in the position. With rapid quenching, the observed sensitivity is in good agreement with a numerical simulation based on the quantum Langevin equation and approaches to the limit given by the quantum Fisher information. Our results open up a pathway to quantum inertial sensing sensitized by exploiting quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>A matter-wave Fabry-P\'erot cavity in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solve this problem uses the classical random walks on the graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our procedure of community detection on a number of graphs and social networks, such as the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, dolphin's social network, etc.</description>

      <title>Imperfect Turing Patterns: Diffusiophoretic Assembly of Hard Spheres via Reaction-Diffusion Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turing patterns are stationary, wave-like structures that emerge from the nonequilibrium assembly of reactive and diffusive components. While they are foundational in biophysics, their classical formulation relies on a single characteristic length scale that balances reaction and diffusion, making them overly simplistic for describing biological patterns, which often exhibit multi-scale structures, grain-like textures, and inherent imperfections. Here, we integrate diffusiophoretically-assisted assembly of finite-sized cells, driven by a background chemical gradient in a Turing pattern, while also incorporating intercellular interactions. This framework introduces key control parameters, such as the P\'{e}clet number, cell size distribution, and intercellular interactions, enabling us to reproduce strikingly similar structural features observed in natural patterns. We report imperfections, including spatial variations in pattern thickness, packing limits, and pattern breakups. Our model not only deepens our understanding but also opens a new line of inquiry into imperfect Turing patterns that deviate from the classical formulation in significant ways.</description>

      <title>An efficient implicit scheme for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratified fluids composed of a sequence of alternate layers show interesting macroscopic properties, which may be quite different from those of the individual constituent fluids. On a macroscopic scale, such systems can be considered a sort of fluid metamaterial. In many cases each fluid layer can be described by Euler equations following the stiffened gas equation of state. The computation of detailed numerical solutions of such stratified material poses several challenges, first and foremost the issue of artificial smearing of material parameters across interface boundaries. Lagrangian schemes completely eliminate this issue, but at the cost of rather stringent time step restrictions. In this work we introduce an implicit numerical method for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The implicit discretization is aimed at bypassing the prohibitive time step restrictions present in flows with stratified media, where one of the materials is particularly dense, or rigid (or both). This is the case for flows of water-air mixtures, air-granular media, or similar high density ratio systems. We will present the novel discretisation approach, which makes extensive use of the remarkable structure of the governing equations in Lagrangian coordinates to find the solution by means of a single implicit discrete wave equation for the pressure field, yielding a symmetric positive definite structure and thus a particularly efficient algorithm. Additionally, we will introduce simple filtering strategies for counteracting the emergence of pressure or density oscillations typically encountered in multimaterial flows, and will present results concerning the robustness, accuracy, and performance of the proposed method, including applications to stratified media with high density and stiffness ratios.</description>

      <title>Model-free Analysis of Scattering and Imaging Data with Escort-Weighted Shannon Entropy and Divergence Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a model-free data analysis framework that leverages escort-weighted Shannon Entropy and several divergence matrices to detect phase transitions in scattering and imaging datasets. By establishing a connection between physical entropy and informational entropy, this approach provides a sensitive method for identifying phase transitions without an explicit physical model or order parameter. We further show that pairwise divergence matrices, including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jeffrey Divergence, Jensen-Shannon Divergence and antisymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence, provide more comprehensive measures of statistical changes than scalar entropy alone. Our approach successfully detects the onset of both long- and short-range order in neutron and X-ray scattering data, as well as a non-trivial phase transition in magnetic skyrmion lattices observed through Lorentz-transition electron microscopy. These results establish a framework for automated, model-free analysis of experimental data with broad applications in materials science and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>3D imaging of the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons are among the most important carriers of quantum information owing to their rich degrees of freedom (DoFs), including various spatiotemporal structures. The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields. This method will further advance the understanding of the dynamics in nonlinear quantum optics and expand the potential of photons for applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Dynamically training machine-learning-based force fields for strongly anharmonic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure Torsion-Induced Transformation of Adenosine Monophosphate: Insights into Prebiotic Chemistry of RNA by Astronomical Impacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of life is yet a compelling scientific mystery that has sometimes been attributed to high-pressure impacts by small solar system bodies such as comets, meteoroids, asteroids, and transitional objects. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an innovative method with which to simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts and offers insights relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

      <description>arXiv:2601.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/\nu = 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.</description>

      <title>Wave generation via oscillatory reconnection at a three-dimensional magnetic null point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work conducts a three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to investigate wave generating, time-dependent reconnection around a magnetic null point. A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfv\'en wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.</description>

      <title>Deeply nonlinear magnon-photon hybrid excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>The roles of bulk and surface thermodynamics in the selective adsorption of a confined azeotropic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid mixtures that exhibit an azeotrope cannot be purified by simple bulk distillation. Consequently, there is strong motivation to understand the behavior of azeotropic mixtures under confinement. We address this problem using a machine-learning-enhanced classical density functional theory applied to a binary Lennard-Jones mixture that exhibits azeotropic phase behavior. As proof-of-principle of a "train once, learn many" strategy, our approach combines a neural functional trained on a single-component repulsive reference system with a mean-field treatment of attractive interactions, derived within the framework of hyperdensity functional theory (hyper-DFT). The theory faithfully describes capillary condensation and results from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by taking advantage of a known accurate equation of state, the theory we present well-describes bulk thermodynamics by construction. Exploiting the computational efficiency of hyper-DFT, we systematically evaluate adsorption selectivity across a wide range of compositions, pressures, temperatures, and wall-fluid affinities. In cases where the wall-fluid interaction is the same for both species, we find that the pore becomes completely unselective at the bulk azeotropic composition. Strikingly, this unselective point persists far from liquid-vapor coexistence, including in the supercritical regime. Analysis of the bulk equation of state across a wide range of thermodynamic state points shows that the azeotropic composition coincides with equal partial molar volumes and an extremum in the isothermal compressibility. A complementary thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that unselective adsorption corresponds to an aneotrope (a point of zero relative adsorption) and an extremum in the interfacial free energy. We also find that the two interfaces of the slit pore behave independently down to remarkably small slits.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid semi-Lagrangian Flow Mapping Approach for Vlasov Systems: Combining Iterative and Compositional Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov--Poisson equation that combines the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method with the Characteristic Mapping Method (CMM). Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Semantic Dynamics Revealed by Allan Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While language progresses through a sequence of semantic states, the underlying dynamics of this progression remain elusive. Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.</description>

      <title>LLM4Fluid: Large Language Models as Generalizable Neural Solvers for Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

      <description>arXiv:2601.21776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of the electrostatic potential is fundamental to the study of condensed phase systems. We discuss the calculation of the relevant lattice summations by Ewald-type techniques. A model charge density is introduced, that cancels multipole moments of the crystalline charge distribution up to a desired order, for accelerating convergence of the Ewald sums. The method is applicable to calculations of bulk systems, employing arbitrary unit cells in a classical or quantum context, and with arbitrary basis functions to represent the charge density. The approach clarifies a decades-old implementation in the CRYSTAL code.</description>

      <title>Rapid high-temperature initialisation and readout of spins in silicon with 10 THz photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.</description>

      <title>Bound-state-free F\"orster resonant shielding of strongly dipolar ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a F\"orster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</description>

Abstract: A growing variety of optically accessible spin qubits have emerged in recent years as key components for quantum sensors, qubits, and quantum memories. However, the scalability of conventional spin-based quantum architectures remains limited by direct microwave delivery, which introduces thermal noise, electromagnetic cross-talk, and design constraints for cryogenic, high-field, and distributed systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for RF-over-fiber (RFoF) control of optically accessible spins through RFoF optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The RFoF platform relies on an electro-optically modulated telecom-band laser that transmits microwave signals over fiber and a high-speed photodiode that recovers the RF waveform to drive NV center spin transitions. We obtain an RFoF efficiency of 1.81\% at 2.90~GHz, corresponding to $P_{\mathrm{RF,out}}=-0.7$~dBm. The RFoF architecture provides a path toward low-noise, thermally isolated, and cryo-compatible ODMR systems bridging conventional spin-based quantum sensing protocols with emerging distributed quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Reconstruction of Four-Dimensional Atmospheric Wind Fields Using Multi-UAS Swarm Observations in a Synthetic Turbulent Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Optimal cross-correlation technique to search for strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.</description>

      <title>DeLTA-BIT: an open-source probabilistic tractography-based deep learning framework for thalamic targeting in functional neurological disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last years in-vivo tractography has assumed an important role in neurosciences, for both research and clinical applications such as non-invasive investigation of brain connectivity and presurgical planning in neurosurgery. In more recent years there has been a growing interest in the applications of diffusion tractography for target identification in functional neurological disorders for an increasingly tailored approach. The growing diffusion of well-established neurosurgical procedures, such as deep brain stimulation or trans-cranial Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound, favored this trend. Tractography can indeed provide more accurate, patient-specific, information about the targeted region if compared to stereotactic atlases. On the other hand, this tractography-based approach is not very physician-friendly, and its heavily time consuming since it needs several hours for Magnetic Resonance Imaging data processing. In this study we propose a novel open-source deep learning framework called DeLTA-BIT (acronym of Deep-learning Local TrActography for BraIn Targeting) for fast target predictions, based on probabilistic tractography. The proposed framework exploits a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the location of the Ventral Intermediate Nucleus of the thalamus (VIM). The CNN was trained on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The model capability in predicting the VIM location was tested both on the HCP (internal validation) and clinical data (external validation). Results from the internal validation have shown good capability in predicting the VIM region (mean DSC = 0.62+- 0.15, mean sDSC=0.76+- 0.17) by using just T1 images as input, in a time scale of fraction of second per subject. As for the clinical data, results have been compared with an atlas-based method demonstrating similar performance, but within a significantly shorter timeframe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles approach to turbulence by employing the electrodynamics of continuous media at the viscous limit to recover the Navier-Stokes equations. We treat oscillators with two orthogonal angular momenta as a spin network with properties applicable to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. The microscopic viscous limit has an irreducible representation that includes $O(3)$ expansion terms for a radiation-dominated fluid with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, equivalent to an oriented toroidal de Sitter space. The turbulence solution in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ lies on 6-choose-3 de Sitter intersections of three orthogonal $n$-tori.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

      <title>OmniLens: Towards Universal Lens Aberration Correction via LensLib-to-Specific Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens optical aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35~1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR). The code and data will be available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Full-wave Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse-design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully-parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. This method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, shortening the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach enables practical and ultrafast design of complex structures that are prohibitively time-consuming for prior inverse design methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Air-Sea Flux Parameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying air-sea fluxes is important for understanding air-sea interactions and improving coupled weather and climate systems. This study introduces a probabilistic framework to represent the highly variable nature of air-sea fluxes, which is missing in deterministic bulk algorithms. Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss. The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates. Stochastic parameterization of air-sea turbulent fluxes can be constructed by sampling from the predicted distributions. Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally. The ensemble spread in stochastic runs is most pronounced during spring restratification.</description>

      <title>Knock Out Slow Extraction Using Betatron Sidebands at High Harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied using efficient noise excitation signals fully covering the respective sidebands. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency and the spill quality. This relation is attributed to the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and an empiric relation between the spectrum, the excitation frequency, and the resulting spill quality is given. Experiments show an additional reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for Knock Out extraction systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic particle under external fields can be useful in various medical applications, gaining access to the whole body if deployed in the bloodstream. Localised drug delivery, haemorrhage control, and cancer treatment are among the applications that have the potential to become revolutionary therapies. Despite this interest, a magnetorheological characterisation of particle-seeded blood has yet to be achieved. In this work, we evaluate the magnetorheological response of blood analogues seeded with paramagnetic particles in different concentrations, under the effects of a uniform, density-varying magnetic field. Through steady shear experiments, we encounter the usual magnetically-induced shear thinning response, and oscillatory shear results point toward significant alterations in the fluids' microstructure. However, experimental limitations make it difficult to accurately evaluate the oscillatory shear response of such rheologically subtle fluids, limiting both the quality and quantity of achievable information. Despite experimental limitations, our results demonstrate that magnetic fields can induce marked and quantifiable rheological changes in seeded blood analogues. The framework established here provides a foundation for future studies on real blood samples and for the design of magnetically responsive biomedical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems with the Dimensional Circle Notation (DCN) in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that DCN increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with DCN, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that task solvers with more transitions between DN and DCN benefit less from the visualization. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</description>

Abstract: To understand how fluctuations arise and are distributed in international trade, a question crucial for economic risk assessment and policymaking, we analyze strong adverse fluctuations-collapsed trades-defined as individual trades with sharp annual volume declines. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades (hyperedges) are clustered and their occurrence decays algebraically with trade volume (weight), which suggests inhomogeneous, epidemic-like spreading of collapse in the international trade hypergraph. Modeling collapse propagation as a contagion process and analyzing its dynamics, we show that a positive degree-weight correlation and a volume-decaying collapse rate synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse. Notably, the degree-weight correlation persisted but the volume-decay of the collapse rate weakened during the 2008-2009 global economic recession, resulting in a broader collapse spread. Our study shows how the interplay between structure and dynamics stabilizes complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how turbulence is reshaped by the presence of externally forced light particles, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations with four-way coupling. The particles are subject to an oscillatory force that in turn locally affects the fluid flow through momentum exchange at the position of the particles. Since the light particles preferentially concentrate in high vorticity regions, this leads to an intricate preferential turbulence modulation. We show that through this modulation, the forced light particles strongly reduce the intermittency of the flow, shedding new light on the delicate relationship between vortex filaments and turbulence intermittency.</description>

      <title>Universal Generalization Theory for Physical Intuitions from Small Artificial Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Physical intuitions are native functions from human brains, yet the understanding of how physical intuitions are formulated has remained elusive. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism that simulates how human brain can quickly develop intuitional understandings from limited observations. Conceiving a training algorithm adapted from the well-known variational principle in physics, small artificial neural networks can possess strong physical intuitions that master the problems of brachistochrone and quantum harmonic oscillators, by learning from a few highly similar samples. Our simulations suggest that the variational principle is the governing mechanism for artificial physical intuitions. This generalization is explained by a unified theory: it arises when the network approximates a solution manifold where the Euler-Lagrange operator is stationary with respect to observation features. Our theory also rationalizes that there is a threshold of artificial neural network size below which satisfactory physical intuitions are not possible. Our work offers insights into how strong physical intuition can be formulated as humans or as artificial intelligences.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of the General Standard Model: A Unified Framework for Particle Physics and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the General Standard Model (GSM), a recently proposed framework that unifies particle physics and cosmology within the Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). Constructed from first principles based exclusively on the intrinsic properties of leptons and quarks, the GSM reveals an enlarged gauge symmetry structure, WS$_{c}$(1,3)$\times$GS(1)$\times$Z$_2$, which extends beyond the conventional U$_Y$(1)$\times$SU$_L$(2)$\times$SU$_C$(3) symmetry of the Standard Model. Here, WS$_{c}$(1,3) = SP(1,3)$\rtimes$W$^{1,3}\rtimes$SP$_c$(1,1) emerges as the conformal inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry. Within GQFT, the GSM provides a consistent unification of the Standard Model of particle physics with cosmological models. It incorporates the four known fundamental interactions, electromagnetic, weak, strong, and gravitational, plus the Higgs scalar interaction, and also predicts novel interactions. These include spin gauge, chirality boost-spin gauge, chiral conformal-spin gauge, and scaling gauge forces, as well as additional scalar interactions. Furthermore, the GSM offers profound insights into the nature of gravity and spacetime and elucidates key mysteries of the dark side of the universe, such as the origins of dark matter, the dynamics of dark energy, and the physics of the early inflationary epoch. By establishing a new theoretical bridge between quantum field theory and general relativity, the GSM opens novel pathways for addressing long-standing challenges in fundamental physics. It provides a unified description of both fundamental interactions and cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runaway electron termination on plasma facing components can trigger material explosions that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Due to the large kinetic energies of the ejected dust particles, their subsequent mechanical impacts on the vessel lead to extensive cratering. Earlier experimental studies of high velocity micrometric tungsten dust collisions with tungsten plates focused exclusively on normal impacts. Here, oblique high velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system. The strong dependence of the crater characteristics and crater morphology on the incident angle is documented. A reliable empirical damage law is extracted for the dependence of the crater depth on the incident angle.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of small bubbles in turbulence in non-dilute conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows laden with small bubbles are ubiquitous in many natural and industrial environments. From the point of view of numerical modeling, to be able to handle a very large number of small bubbles in direct numerical simulations, one traditionally relies on the one-way coupling paradigm. There, bubbles are passively advected and are non-interacting, implicitly assuming dilute conditions. Here, we study bubbles that are four-way coupled, where both the feedback on the fluid and excluded-volume interactions between bubbles are taken into account. We find that, while the back-reaction from the bubble phase onto the fluid phase remains energetically small under most circumstances, the excluded-volume interactions between bubbles can have a significant influence on the Lagrangian statistics of the bubble dynamics. We show that as the volume fraction of bubbles increases, the preferential concentration of bubbles in filamentary high-vorticity regions decreases as these strong vortical structures get filled up; this happens at a volume fraction of around one percent for $\textrm{Re}_\lambda=O(10^2)$. We furthermore study the influence on the Lagrangian velocity structure function as well as pair dispersion, and find that, while the mean dispersive behavior remains close to that obtained from one-way coupling simulations, some evident signatures of bubble collisions can be retrieved from the structure functions and the distribution of the dispersion, even at very small volume fractions. This work not only teaches us about the circumstances under which four-way coupling becomes important, but also opens up new directions towards probing and ultimately manipulating coherent vortical structures in small-scale turbulence using bubbles.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Optical Butterworth Fabry-P\'erot Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filters with flat-top pass-bands are a key enabling technology for signal processing. From communication to sensing, the ability to choose a pass \emph{band}, rather than a single pass \emph{frequency}, while still efficiently suppressing backgrounds at other frequencies, is a critical capability for ensuring both detection sensitivity and power efficiency. Efficient transmission of a single frequency can be achieved by a single-pole resonator -- which in optics is a Fabry-P\'erot cavity offering linewidths from kHz to GHz and beyond. Coupling multiple resonators allows for the construction of flat-top multi-pole filters. These, although straightforward from RF to THz where resonators are macroscopic and tunable, are more difficult to control in the optical band and typically realized with dielectric stacks, whose passband widths exceed 100 GHz. Here, we bridge the gap to narrower bandwidth flat-top filters by proposing and implementing a second-order Butterworth-type optical filter in a single two-mirror Fabry-P\'erot cavity, by coupling the two polarization modes. We demonstrate a pass-band width of 2.68(1)~GHz, a maximum stopband suppression of 43~dB, and a passband insertion loss of 2.2(1)~dB, with out-of-band power suppression falling as the fourth power of detuning. This approach is viable down to much narrower filters, and has the potential to improve high-frequency phase noise performance of lasers, enhance the sensitivity of LIDARs, and provide higher quality narrowband filtering, for example, for Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ocean neutral transport: sub-Riemannian geometry and hypoelliptic diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport and mixing of tracers in the ocean is thought to be preferentially along neutral planes defined by the potential temperature and salinity fields. This gives rise to a conceptual model of ocean transport in which water parcel trajectories are everywhere neutral, that is, tangent to the neutral planes. Because the distribution of neutral planes is not integrable, neutral transport, while locally two dimensional, is globally three dimensional. We describe this form of transport, building on its connection with contact and sub-Riemannian geometry.
  We discuss a Lie-bracket interpretation of local dianeutral transport, the quantitative meaning of helicity and the implications of the accessibility theorem. We compute sub-Riemnanian geodesics for climatological neutral planes and put forward the use of the associated Carnot--Carath\'eodory distance as a diagnostic of the strong anisotropy of neutral transport.
  We propose a stochastic toy model of neutral transport which represents motion along neutral planes by a Brownian motion. The corresponding diffusion process is degenerate and not (strongly) elliptic. The non-integrability of the neutral planes however ensures that the diffusion is hypoelliptic. As a result, trajectories are not confined to surfaces but visit the entire three-dimensional ocean. The short-time behaviour is qualitatively different from that obtained with a non-degenerate highly anisotropic diffusion. We examine both short- and long-time behaviours using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations provide an estimate for the time scale of ocean vertical transport implied by the constraint of neutrality.</description>

      <title>The seeding method: A test case for classical nucleation theory in small systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.</description>

Abstract: The original article [1] can be logically divided into two parts: 1) the selection of main parameters for monochromatization and 2) interaction region optics design; the comment pertains only to the first part. The authors of [1] state that "The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of realistic IR optics designs for monochromatization at the FCC-ee". However, the proposed parameters do not seem very realistic and raise many questions; due to space limitations, we will only consider the most important ones.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure holographic 3D printing via inverse-designed phase masks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing using light is commonly constrained by serial voxel-by-voxel or layer-by-layer processing, which fundamentally limits fabrication speed and scalability. Here, we introduce a single-exposure holographic three-dimensional (3D) printing approach that synthesizes an entire volumetric dose distribution optically in one step. The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($&gt;10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself. Because the volumetric information capacity scales with the space--bandwidth product of the phase mask, this approach provides a clear pathway toward substantially higher throughput, enabling scalable fabrication of micro-optical components, biomedical scaffolds, and other precision-engineered mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Irregularities Product: a data product utilizing the high-resolution Swarm plasma density data for space weather applications</title>

Abstract: We use the high-resolution Swarm faceplate plasma density data at 16 Hz to develop a set of parameters that can characterize multi-scale ionospheric structures and irregularities along the Swarm orbit. We present the methods for calculating density gradients over different window sizes, rate of change of density index, power spectral density and the spectral slope at both low and high latitudes. The faceplate plasma data are not continuously available through the years. However, about 8 years of data from Swarm A are processed from late 2014 to the end of 2025. Some statistical results from Swarm A are presented. The variations of plasma structures and irregularities are dependent on solar activity, season, local time and geomagnetic activities, and the variations show different patterns between low and high latitudes. For example, the high-latitude ionosphere is characterized by persistent ionospheric structures and irregularities poleward of 60 magnetic latitude, while the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities are only dominant during 19-01 local time near the magnetic equator. The occurrence of steep spectral slope at high latitudes shows clear seasonal variations, i.e., it maximizes during local summer and minimizes during local winter in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence of steep spectral slope at low latitudes is only sensible when significant plasma structures and irregularities are present. We further calculate the histogram of spectral slopes at low latitudes when the rate of change of density index is enhanced. The histogram resembles a Gaussian distribution with an expected value of 1.97. The processed data are available to the wider community. Given the high resolution, this new data product will be useful for the scientific communities that are interested in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and near-Earth space environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ $\Delta$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transformer operator for the prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven turbulence prediction methods often face challenges related to data dependency and lack of physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed Transformer operator (PITO) and its implicit variant (PIITO) for predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulence, which are developed based on the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an appropriate patch size. Given the current flow field, the Transformer operator computes its prediction for the next time step. By embedding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations into the loss function, PITO and PIITO can learn solution operators without using labeled data. Furthermore, PITO can automatically learn the subgrid scale (SGS) coefficient using a single set of flow data during training. Both PITO and PIITO exhibit excellent stability and accuracy on the predictions of various statistical properties and flow structures for the situation of long-term extrapolation exceeding 25 times the training horizon in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and outperform the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). Furthermore, PITO exhibits a remarkable accuracy on the predictions of forced HIT where PIFNO fails. Notably, PITO and PIITO reduce GPU memory consumption by 79.5\% and 91.3\% while requiring only 31.5\% and 3.1\% of the parameters, respectively, compared to PIFNO. Moreover, both PITO and PIITO models are much faster compared to traditional LES method.</description>

      <title>A universal black-box quantum Monte Carlo approach to quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-threshold time series analysis enables characterization of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, so called Dunkelflaute events, emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Framework for Physical Laws Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering explicit physical laws has traditionally depended on human intuition and domain expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a new route to accelerate this process by automating key steps from hypothesis generation to interpretable model construction. Here we develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework for physical-law discovery that integrates literature-guided variable selection, hypothesis formulation, symbolic regression, formula derivation, and mechanistic explanation. We validate the framework on three representative materials problems: the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses, the Vickers hardness of compounds, and the Young's modulus of multi-component alloys. Using physically and chemically meaningful descriptors as inputs, the discovered formulas achieve strong agreement with reference data, with correlation coefficients up to 0.94 (GFA), 0.86 (hardness), and 0.94 (Young's modulus), while remaining compact and interpretable. Beyond fitting, the Young's modulus formula generalizes to quaternary and quinary alloys, improving prediction accuracy by up to 78.8% relative to the classical rule of mixtures. By integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge, reflection mechanisms, and expert-like reasoning ability into symbolic regression, our AI-centric framework offers a robust and extensible platform for automated physical laws discovery, demonstrating that AI can increasingly serve as an essential role in modern scientific research by thinking and acting like field experts.</description>

      <title>Observation of dislocation bound states and skin effects in non-Hermitian Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

      <title>Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Living Droplets with Mesoscale Swimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</description>

      <title>MORPH: PDE Foundation Models with Arbitrary Data Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters, MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</description>

      <title>Photon triplets from integrated microrings: A path towards deterministic non-Gaussianity on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the predicted accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Aging in the Flow Dynamics of Dense Suspensions of Contactless Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.</description>
