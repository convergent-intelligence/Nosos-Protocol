      <title>The Noncomputability of Immune Reaction Complexity: Algorithmic Information Gaps under Effective Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a validity-filtered, certificate-based view of reactions grounded in Algorithmic Information Theory. A fixed, total, input-blind executor maps a self-delimiting advice string to a candidate response, accepted only if a decidable or semi-decidable validity predicate V(x, r) holds. The minimum feasible realizer complexity M(x) = min_{r: V(x,r)=1} K(r), with K denoting prefix Kolmogorov complexity, measures the minimal information required for a valid outcome. We define the Normalized Advice Quantile (NAQ) as the percentile of M(x) across a reference pool, yielding a scale-free hardness index on [0, 1] robust to the choice of universal machine and comparable across task families. An Exact Realizer Identity shows that the minimal advice for any input-blind executor equals M(x) up to O(1), while a description plus selection upper bound refines it via computable feature maps, separating description cost K(y) from selection cost log i_y(x). In finite-ambiguity regimes M(x) approximately equals min_y K(y); in generic-fiber regimes the bound is tight. NAQ is quasi-invariant under bounded enumeration changes. An operational converse links NAQ to rate-distortion: communicating advice with error epsilon requires average length near the entropy of target features. Extensions include a resource-bounded variant NAQ_t incorporating time-penalized complexity (Levin's Kt) and an NP-style setting showing linear worst-case advice n - O(1). Finally, a DKW bound guarantees convergence of empirical NAQ estimates, enabling data-driven calibration via compressor-based proxies.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Near-Optimal Performance of the Synchronous Nyquist-Folding Generalized Eigenvalue Method (SNGEM) for Sub-Nyquist Multi-Tone Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronous Nyquist folding generalized eigenvalue method (SNGEM) realizes full frequency/amplitude/phase estimation of multitone signals at extreme sub-Nyquist rates by jointly processing the original signals and their time derivatives. In this paper, accurate Cramer-Rao bounds for amplitude ratio parameter R=A/B=1/(2\pif) are derived for two channels with equal SNR. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm that SNGEM achieves machine accuracy in noise-free conditions and closely approaches the derived CRB at all SNR levels, even at 10- 20x compression, whereas classical compressive sensing OMP exhibits irreducible error flattening due to DFT grid bias and aliasing noise. These results establish SNGEM as a statistically nearly optimal deterministic sub-Nyquist parameter spectrum analysis</description>

      <title>Missing digits and sums of two prime squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate integers whose base $g$ expansion omits a fixed digit and which can be represented as a sum of two prime squares. In the first part of the paper, we apply the Hardy--Littlewood circle method to obtain asymptotic formulas for weighted count of representations of such integers up to $g^k$ as $k\to\infty$, where we weight by the von Mangoldt function. In this case, we also get an interesting bias depending on the fixed digit we are missing. In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\{ n \leq g^k : n \text{ omits the digit } b \text{ in its base } g \text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \text{ for some primes } p,q \}. $$</description>

      <title>The augmented NLP bound for maximum-entropy remote sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum-entropy remote sampling problem (MERSP) is to select a subset of s random variables from a set of n random variables, so as to maximize the information concerning a set of target random variables that are not directly observable. We assume throughout that the set of all of these random variables follows a joint Gaussian distribution, and that we have the covariance matrix available. Finally, we measure information using Shannon's differential entropy.
  The main approach for exact solution of moderate-sized instances of MERSP has been branch-and-bound, and so previous work concentrated on upper bounds. Prior to our work, there were two upper-bounding methods for MERSP: the so-called NLP bound and the spectral bound, both introduced 25 years ago. We are able now to establish domination results between these two upper bounds. We propose an ``augmented NLP bound'' based on a subtle convex relaxation. We provide theoretical guarantees, giving sufficient conditions under which the augmented NLP bound strictly dominates the ordinary NLP bound. In addition, the augmented NLP formulation allows us to derive upper bounds for rank-deficient covariance matrices when they satisfy a technical condition. This is in contrast to the earlier work on the ordinary NLP bound that worked with only positive definite covariance matrices. Finally, we introduce a novel and very effective diagonal-scaling technique for MERSP, employing a positive vector of parameters. Numerical experiments on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in advancing the state of the art for calculating upper bounds on MERSP.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling Algorithm for Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic differential game with $N$ competitive players in a linear-quadratic framework with ergodic cost, where $d$-dimensional diffusion processes govern the state dynamics with an unknown common drift (matrix). Assuming a Gaussian prior on the drift, we use filtering techniques to update its posterior estimates. Based on these estimates, we propose a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm with dynamic episode lengths to approximate strategies. We show that the Bayesian regret for each player has an error bound of order $O(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$, where $T$ is the time-horizon, independent of the number of players. This implies that average regret per unit time goes to zero. Finally, we prove that the algorithm results in a Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The dual-path fixing strategy and its application to the set-covering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the dual-path fixing strategy to exploit dual algorithms for solving relaxations of mixed-integer nonlinear-optimization problems. Such dual algorithms are naturally applied in the context of branch-and-bound, and eventual impact on the success of branch-and-bound is our strong motivation. Our fixing strategy aims to be more powerful than the common strategy of fixing variables based on a single dual-feasible solution (e.g., standard reduced-cost fixing for mixed-integer linear optimization), but to be much faster than ``strong fixing'', essentially requiring no more time than that of the dual algorithm that we exploit. We have successfully tested our ideas on mixed-integer linear-optimization set-covering instances from the literature, in the context of the dual-simplex method applied to the continuous relaxations.</description>

      <title>Solution of Advection Equation with Discontinuous Initial and Boundary Conditions via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate several techniques for modeling the one-dimensional advection equation for a specific class of problems with discontinuous initial and boundary conditions using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To mitigate the spectral bias phenomenon, we employ a Fourier feature mapping layer as the input representation, adopt a two-stage training strategy in which the Fourier feature parameters and the neural network weights are optimized sequentially, and incorporate adaptive loss weighting. To further enhance the approximation accuracy, a median filter is applied to the spatial data, and the predicted solution is constrained through a bounded linear mapping. Moreover, for certain nonlinear problems, we introduce a modified loss function inspired by the upwind numerical scheme to alleviate the excessive smoothing of discontinuous solutions typically observed in neural network approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $D$ and an ordinary isogeny class of abelian varieties defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with commutative $\mathbb{F}_q$-endomorphism algebra, we provide algorithms for computing all isogenies of degree dividing $D$ and polarizations of degree dividing $D$. We discuss phenomena that arise for higher dimension abelian varieties but not elliptic curves, bounds on the diameter of the graph of minimal isogenies, and decompositions of isogeny graphs into orbits for the Picard group of the Frobenius order.</description>

      <title>Maximizing subgraph counts in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we investigate the $d$-regular graphs $G$ with the highest $H$-density. We reframe the problem as a continuous optimization problem on the eigenvalues of $G$ by relating injective homomorphism numbers from $H$ and homomorphism numbers from quotient graphs of $H$. For almost all $H$, this relation has non-spectral terms, which require bounding by spectral terms in a way that is sharp at the optimal graph.
  For bipartite $H$ and $d$ large enough, we show $G$ consists of disjoint copies of $K_{d,d}$. For non-bipartite $H$ and $d$ sufficiently large, $G$ is a collection of disjoint $K_{d+1}$ graphs. For $H=C_5$ and $d=3$, disjoint Petersen graphs emerge.</description>

      <title>Gliders on the Stranded Cellular Automata Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stranded Cellular Automata (SCA) model consists of a grid of cells which can each contain between zero and two strands apiece and two turning rules that control when strands turn and when they cross. While patterns on this model have been studied previously, such research has not needed an algebraic description of the model. We provide a formal algebraic definition of patterns on the model, define gliders on the model in a way which is semi-compatible with definitions of gliders in other cellular automata models, and classify all 1- and 2-stranded gliders on this model. In addition, we prove an equivalence of two classes of gliders and design an algorithm to generate all such elements of that class.</description>

      <title>Power consumption Reduction in ELAA-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider power consumption reduction in extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. Although ELAAs are critical for achieving high-resolution near-field sensing, fully activating all antenna elements in conventional digital architectures leads to prohibitive power demands. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient subarray activation framework that selects an optimal subset of subarrays to minimize the total power consumption, subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for both sensing and communication. We formulate a novel optimization problem and solve it using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining dual-function performance.</description>

      <title>Global oscillatory solutions for the Yang-Mills heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics for the global solution of the $SO(4)$-equivariant Yang-Mills heat flow (YMHF) with structure group $SU(2)$ in space dimension $4$. For a class of initial data with specific decay at spatial infinity, we prove that the long-time dynamics of YMHF can be described by the initial data in a unified manner. As a consequence, the global solutions can exhibit blow-up, blow-down, and more exotically, {\it oscillatory} asymptotic behavior at time infinity. This seems to be the first example of Yang-Mills heat flows with oscillatory behavior as $t\to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a (sub)diffusion equation with a nonlinearity of the form $pf(u)-qu$, where $p$ and $q$ are space dependent functions. Prominent examples are the Fisher-KPP, the Frank-Kamenetskii-Zeldovich and the Allen-Cahn equations. We devise a fixed point scheme for reconstructing the spatially varying coefficients from interior observations a) at final time under two different excitations b) at two different time instances under a single excitation. Convergence of the scheme as well as local uniqueness of these coefficients is proven. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the reconstruction scheme.</description>

      <title>Towards regularized learning from functional data with covariate shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a general regularization framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in vector-valued regression under the covariate shift assumption, utilizing vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vRKHS). Covariate shift occurs when the input distributions of the training and test data differ, introducing significant challenges for reliable learning. By restricting the hypothesis space, we develop a practical operator learning algorithm capable of handling functional outputs. We establish optimal convergence rates for the proposed framework under a general source condition, providing a theoretical foundation for regularized learning in this setting. We also propose an aggregation-based approach that forms a linear combination of estimators corresponding to different regularization parameters and different kernels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate tuning parameters, which is crucial for constructing a good estimator, and we provide a theoretical justification for its effectiveness. Furthermore, we illustrate the proposed method on a real-world face image dataset, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in mitigating distributional discrepancies under covariate shift.</description>

      <title>The fractal geometry of opinion formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce and study a variant of the agent-based opinion dynamics proposed in a recent work [8], within the framework of an interacting multi-agent system, where agents are assumed to interact with each other and update their opinions after each pairwise encounter. Specifically, our opinion model involves a large crowd of $N$ indistinguishable agents, each characterized by an opinion value ranging within the interval $[-1,1]$. At each update time, two agents are picked uniformly at random and the opinion of one agent will either shift by a proportion $\mu_+ \in (0,1]$ towards $+1$, or by a proportion $\mu_- \in (0,1]$ towards $-1$, with probabilities depending on the other agent's opinion. We rigorously derive the mean-field limit PDE that governs the large-population limit of the agent-based model and present several quantitative results demonstrating convergence to the unique equilibrium distribution. Remarkably, for a suitable choice of model parameters, the long-term equilibrium opinion profile displays a striking self-similar structure that generalizes the celebrated Bernoulli convolution, a topic extensively studied in the context of fractal geometry [23,44]. These findings also enhance our understanding of the opinion fragmentation phenomenon and may provide valuable insights for the development of more sophisticated models in future research.</description>

      <title>A proof of Spence's formula using the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1963, Edward Spence published a proof of the following
  With $\phi$ being Euler totient function, if $n&gt;1$ is an integer, and if \begin{equation*} 0&lt;a_1&lt;\cdots&lt;a_{\phi(n)}&lt;n, \end{equation*} are the positive integers less than $n$, coprime with $n$, then \begin{equation*} \sum_{j=1}^{\phi(n)}ja_j = \frac{\phi(n)}{24}\left(8n\phi(n)+6n+2\phi(m)(-1)^{\omega(m)}-2^{\omega(m)}\right), \end{equation*} where $m$ is the square-free part of $n$ and $\omega(m)$ is the number of prime factors of $m$.
  Spence's proof relies on an ingenious observation considering Nagell's totient function. Later in 1971, Lucien Van Hamme provided an alternative proof of the result using Fourier analysis and previous work from Hubert Delange in 1968. In this paper I propose another proof of the formula using the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums. If the formula is of interest on its own, it also plays a role in the analysis of the distribution of the $a_j$ as suggested by the work from Hubert Delange.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Rees construction and pure motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Rees construction (of common use in commutative algebra and Hodge theory) interpolates between filtrations, viewed as ${\mathbb G}_m$-equivariant vector bundles on the affine line, and their associated gradings. Various non-abelian versions have been proposed, where the multiplicative group ${\mathbb G}_m$ is replaced by an arbitrary reductive group. Building on a construction due to P. O'Sullivan, we present a Galois correspondence between quasi-homogeneous spaces and certain monoidal categories, and apply it to monoidal categories of motives with concrete applications to algebraic cycles. In particular, we give a new proof and generalization of the Clozel-Deligne theorem about numerical equivalence on abelian varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Trimmed branching random walk and a free obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $N$ particles performing random walks on the $\epsilon$-grid $(\epsilon Z)^d$, $\epsilon&gt;0$ with branching and density-dependent selection: When one of the particles branches, a particle is removed from the most populated site. The walks are assumed to be asymptotic, as $\epsilon\to0$, to diffusion processes of the form \[ dX_i(t)=b(X_i(t))dt+\sqrt{2}dW_i(t), \] for $b$ a given vector field. Denoting $L^*=\Delta-\nabla\cdot(b\,\cdot)$, the hydrodynamic limit, as $N\to\infty$ followed by $\epsilon\to0$, is characterized in terms of a parabolic free obstacle problem \[ \partial_t u=L^*u+u-\beta \] where $\beta$ is a measure on $R^d\times[0,\infty)$ supported on $\{(x,t):u(x,t)=|u(\cdot,t)|_\infty\}$. Here, the unknowns are $u$, the mass density, and $\beta$, the removal measure, for which $t\mapsto\beta(R^d\times[0,t])$ is prescribed. This is analogous to the well-understood relation between particle systems with spatial selection and free boundary problems, but the techniques require quite different ideas. The key ingredients of the proof include PDE uniqueness for continuous densities and a uniform-in-$\epsilon$ estimate on modulus of continuity of prelimit densities. The work gives rise to open problems such as ``flat top'' versus ``sharp top'' solutions, which are discussed based on concrete examples.</description>

      <title>On the Vanishing and Cuspidality of $D_4$ Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop vanishing and cuspidality criteria for quaternionic modular forms on $G=\mathrm{Spin}(4,4)$ using a theory of scalar Fourier coefficients. By analyzing a Fourier-Jacobi expansion for these forms, we prove that a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ vanishes if and only if its primitive Fourier coefficients are zero. Using this criterion, we characterize Pollack's quaternionic Saito-Kurokawa subspace by imposing a system of linear relation among certain primitive Fourier coefficients. This characterization strengthens earlier work of the author with Johnson-Leung, Negrini, Pollack, and Roy. We also study quaternionic modular forms in the more general setting of a group $G_J$ associated to a cubic norm structure $J$. Here we establish a new relationship between the degenerate Fourier coefficients of quaternionic modular forms, and the Fourier coefficients of the holomorphic modular forms associated to their constant terms. As a consequence, we prove that in weights $\ell\geq 5$, a level one quaternionic modular form on $G$ is cuspidal if and only if its non-degenerate Fourier coefficients satisfy a polynomial growth condition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Newton's method for odd and even elliptic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Newton's method applied to any odd or any even elliptic function with an arbitrary period lattice. For any function of this type whose set of poles coincides with its period lattice, we show that the Julia set of its Newton map is connected, as long as no Herman rings exist. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions on the Newton's method of any odd or even elliptic function to exhibit wandering domains coexisting with attracting basins. This phenomenon was first reported by Florido and Fagella for the Newton's method applied to a family of entire functions; however, our approach does not employ the lifting technique. We also provide a detailed study of a one-parameter family of elliptic functions given by $\wp_\Lambda+b$ with $\Lambda$ any triangular period lattice and $b\in\mathbb{C}$. We show that their associated Newton maps do not exhibit Herman rings or Baker domains, and any other Fatou component, including wandering, is bounded.</description>

      <title>The quenched structured coalescent for diploid population models on finite graphs with large migrations and uneven offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we describe a new model for the evolution of a diploid structured population backwards in time that allows for large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. The model generalizes both the mean-field model of Birkner et al. [\textit{Electron. J. Probab.} 23: 1-44 (2018)] and the haploid structured model of M\"{o}hle [\textit{Theor. Popul. Biol.} 2024 Apr:156:103-116]. We show convergence, with mild conditions on the joint distribution of offspring frequencies and migrations, of gene genealogies conditional on the pedigree to a time-inhomogeneous coalescent process driven by a Poisson point process $\Psi$ that records the timing and scale of large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. This quenched scaling limit demonstrates a significant difference in the predictions of the classical annealed theory of structured coalescent processes. In particular, the annealed and quenched scaling limits coincide if and only if these large migrations and uneven offspring distributions are absent. The proof proceeds by the method of moments and utilizes coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments. Several examples are given and their quenched scaling limits established.</description>

      <title>Parametric Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: A Unified Framework for Conservation, Entropy Stability, and Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a parametric hyperbolic conservation law (SymCLaw) for learning hyperbolic systems directly from data while ensuring conservation, entropy stability, and hyperbolicity by design. Unlike existing approaches that typically enforce only conservation or rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations, our method parameterizes the flux functions in a form that guarantees real eigenvalues and complete eigenvectors of the flux Jacobian, thereby preserving hyperbolicity. At the same time, we embed entropy-stable design principles by jointly learning a convex entropy function and its associated flux potential, ensuring entropy dissipation and the selection of physically admissible weak solutions. A corresponding entropy-stable numerical flux scheme provides compatibility with standard discretizations, allowing seamless integration into classical solvers. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems, including Burgers, shallow water, Euler, and KPP equations, demonstrate that SymCLaw generalizes to unseen initial conditions, maintains stability under noisy training data, and achieves accurate long-time predictions, highlighting its potential as a principled foundation for data-driven modeling of hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decaying half-line Schr\"odinger operators and the local eigenvalue spacing of their Dirichlet restrictions. While absolutely continuous spectrum is strongly associated with bulk universality and clock behavior, singular spectral measures can correspond to varied local behaviors. In this work, the rate of decay of the potential is shown to give upper bounds for the spacing of Dirichlet eigenvalues on finite intervals.</description>

Abstract: We take two approaches to classifying the complexity of Presburger models: Scott analysis and degree spectra. In particular, we investigate the possible Scott sentence complexities and possible degree spectra of models of Presburger arithmetic. Many of our results will be achieved by showing how given a linear order $\mathcal{L}$, we can construct a Presburger group $P_\mathcal{L}$ that maintains much of the structure of $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of weight enumerators for codes generated by an integral matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of error-correcting codes, the minimum weight and the weight enumerator play a crucial role in evaluating the error-correcting capacity. In this paper, by viewing the weight enumerator as a quasi-polynomial, we reduce the calculation of the minimum weight to that of a code over a smaller integer residue ring. We also give a transformation formula between the Tutte quasi-polynomial and the weight enumerator. Furthermore, we compute the number of maximum weight codewords for the codes related to the matroids $N_k$ and $Z_k$. This is equivalent to computing the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the hyperplane arrangements related to $N_k$ and $Z_k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite poset $P$, we study the expected size of the intersection of two independent uniformly random antichains. Equivalently, we evaluate the sum of $|A\cap A'|$ over all ordered pairs of antichains. For general posets this statistic appears to have little structure, but for the classical minuscule posets with uniform combinatorial models it admits closed-form expressions. Though the proofs are elementary and combinatorial, the resulting formulas admit a natural interpretation in terms of weight diagrams of minuscule representations.</description>

      <title>Thompson sampling: Precise arm-pull dynamics and adaptive inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.
  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.
  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.
  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic H\"ormander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves that, at the first singular time for a smoothly immersed surface moving by mean curvature flow in a n-manifold, each tangent flow is given by a smooth, branched shrinker, possibly with multiplicity. If n=3 and if the initial surface is embedded, then the shrinker is smoothly embedded without branch points, but possibly with multiplicity. A key ingredient of the proof is a new, local version of the Gauss-Bonnet formula.</description>

      <title>Comparability in Bruhat orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the sharp asymptotic scale of the probability that two uniformly random permutations are comparable in weak Bruhat order, showing that $\mathbb{P}(\sigma_1 \preceq_W \sigma_2)=\exp\Bigl(\bigl(-\tfrac12+o(1)\bigr)\,n\log n\Bigr)$. This significantly improves both of the best known bounds, due to Hammett and Pittel, which placed this probability between $\exp((-1+o(1))n\log n)$ and $\exp(-\Theta(n))$. We also improve the best known lower bound for strong Bruhat-order comparability, due to the same authors, by proving a subexponential lower bound. The Bruhat orders are natural partial orders on the symmetric group, appearing in wide-reaching settings including the geometry of flag manifolds, the representation theory of $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, and the combinatorics of the permutohedron. To analyze weak Bruhat order, we combine classic analytic, tableau-theoretic, and poset-theoretic tools, including the Plancherel measure and the RSK bijection. For strong Bruhat order we construct large families where members are comparable with high probability. Our proof that members are comparable combines the tableau criterion with an associated random-walk-type deviation process.</description>

      <title>Noisy Pairwise-Comparison Random Search for Smooth Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimizing high-dimensional smooth nonconvex objectives using only noisy pairwise comparisons. Unlike classical zeroth-order methods limited by the ambient dimension $d$, we propose Noisy-Comparison Random Search (NCRS), a direct-search method that exploits random line search to adapt to the intrinsic dimension $k \le d$. We establish novel non-convex convergence guarantees for approximate stationarity: under a uniform-margin oracle, NCRS attains $\epsilon$-stationarity with complexity $\mathcal{O}(k/(p^{2}\epsilon^{2}))$, explicitly replacing ambient dependence with the intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a general tie-aware noise model where comparison quality degrades near ties; for this setting, we prove that a majority-vote variant of NCRS achieves $\epsilon$-stationarity with complexity $\mathcal{O}(k^{2}/\epsilon^{4})$.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformations of the Tsetlin library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tsetlin library is a random shuffling process on permutations of $n$ letters, where each letter $i$ can be interpreted as a book; book $i$ is brought to the front of the bookshelf with an assigned probability $x_i$. We define a $q$-deformation of the Tsetlin library by replacing the symmetric group action on permutations by the action of the type $A$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We compute the stationary distribution and spectrum of this Markov chain by relating it to a Markov chain on complete flags over the finite field vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and applying techniques from semigroup theory. We also generalize the $q$-Tsetlin library to words (with repeated letters), and compute its stationary distribution and spectrum.</description>

      <title>A family of simple $U(\mathfrak{h})$-free modules of rank 2 over $\mathfrak{sl} (2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-modules over $\mathbb C$ that are free of finite rank as $U(\mathfrak h)$-modules, where $\mathfrak h$ is a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$. Our main result is an explicit classification of the scalar-type simple modules of rank $2$. We also give a criterion for when two such modules are isomorphic. Both the classification and the isomorphism problem reduce to twisted conjugacy classes in $\mbox{GL}_2({\mathbb C}[h])$ and rely on Cohn's standard form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J.~Rosen introduced the ring $\mathcal{P}^0_{\mathcal{A}}$ of so-called finite algebraic numbers, which may be seen as an analogue of certain periods in the ring $\mathcal{A}=\prod_p \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} /\bigoplus_p \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, $p$ running through all prime numbers. In this article, we introduce its positive characteristic analogue $\mathcal{P}^0_{\mathcal{A}_K}$ over the rational function field $K=\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$, $q$ being a prime power, and study foundational properties.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the Boltzmann equations for gas mixture with unequal molecular masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation is essential for gas thermodynamics,as it models how the molecular density distribution $F(t,x,v)$ changes over time. However, existing research primarily focuses on the single species Boltzmann equation, while investigations into gas mixtures with unequal molecular masses remain relatively limited. Notably, mixed gas studies have broader applications exemplified by Earth's atmosphere, composed of 78\% nitrogen, 21\% oxygen, and 1\% trace gases, where the $N_2$ to $O_2$ molecular mass ratio is 28:32 (simplified as 7:8). This work addresses the Boltzmann equations for such mixtures with unequal molecular masses $(m^A\neq m^B)$, establishing the global in time existence of classical solutions near Maxwellians for soft potentials ($-3&lt;\gamma&lt;0$) in a periodic spatial domain. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. The main contribution of this paper lies in the detailed characterization of the linear collision operator's structure and establishing estimates for the nonlinear terms under unequal mass conditions. Consequently, these results may help advance spectral analysis for soft potentials as well as $L^2,L^{\infty}$ frameworks in future studies of multi-component Boltzmann equations.</description>

      <title>Rationality of quaternionic Eisenstein series on $\mathrm{U}(2,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{G}=\mathrm{U}(2,n)$ be the unitary group associated to a Hermitian space over a quadratic imaginary number field $E$. We assume that 2 is unramified in $E$, and the Hermitian space splits at all finite places and has signature $(2,n)$, where $n\equiv 2 \operatorname{mod} 4$. A theory of Fourier expansions of quaternionic modular forms on $\mathbf{G}$ is developed by Hilado, McGlade, and Yan. In this paper, we define a family of degenerate Heisenberg Eisenstein series $E_{\ell}$ for $\ell&gt;n$ on $\mathbf{G}$, which is a weight $\ell$ quaternionic modular form, and we explicitly compute their Fourier expansions. We prove that the Fourier coefficients of $E_{\ell}$ are rational in a certain sense, and that their denominators are uniformly bounded by an integer depending only on $\ell,n$, and $E$. This provides the first family of quaternionic Eisenstein series whose Fourier coefficients are known to be rational or algebraic.</description>

      <title>Wave Packets and Eigenvalue Estimates for Limiting Operators on the Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional spatio-spectral limiting operators \[ T_R := P_{D(R)} B_S P_{D(R)} : L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L^2(\mathbb{R}^2), \] where $D(R)$ is a disk of radius $R&gt;1$, $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a domain with well-shaped boundary, $P_{D(R)}$ is the orthogonal projection on the subspace of functions supported on $D(R)$, and $B_S$ is the orthogonal projection on the subspace of functions whose Fourier transform is supported on $S$. We construct a disk-adapted wave-packet frame for $L^2(D(R))$ with frame bounds uniform in $R$ using Gevrey-$s$ cutoffs ($s&gt;1$) to obtain near-exponential Fourier localization. Exploiting these localization estimates, we bound the size of the eigenvalue plunge-region for $T_R$ and prove that for each $s&gt;1$ and each $\varepsilon\in(0,1/2)$, \[ \#\{k : \lambda_k(T_R)\in(\varepsilon,1-\varepsilon)\} = O\!\left(R (\log(R/\varepsilon))^{1+2s}\right), \] with constants depending on $s$ and the geometric parameters of $S$. This bound improves existing plunge-region estimates in the classical setting where both domains are disks, when $\varepsilon$ scales like $R^{-\nu}$ for a fixed $\nu &gt; 0$. By an affine transformation, the same result holds if $D(R)$ is a scaled ellipse.</description>

      <title>Deletion-correcting codes for an adversarial nanopore channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deletion-correcting codes for an adversarial nanopore channel in which at most $t$ deletions may occur. We propose an explicit construction of $q$-ary codes of length $n$ for this channel with $2t\log_q n+\Theta(\log\log n)$ redundant symbols. We also show that the optimal redundancy is between $t\log_q n+\Omega(1)$ and $2t\log_q n-\log_q\log_2 n+O(1)$, so our explicit construction matches the existential upper bound to first order. In contrast, for the classical adversarial $q$-ary deletion channel, the smallest redundancy achieved by known explicit constructions that correct up to $t$ deletions is $4t(1+\epsilon)\log_q n+o(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>An efficient implicit scheme for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stratified fluids composed of a sequence of alternate layers show interesting macroscopic properties, which may be quite different from those of the individual constituent fluids. On a macroscopic scale, such systems can be considered a sort of fluid metamaterial. In many cases each fluid layer can be described by Euler equations following the stiffened gas equation of state. The computation of detailed numerical solutions of such stratified material poses several challenges, first and foremost the issue of artificial smearing of material parameters across interface boundaries. Lagrangian schemes completely eliminate this issue, but at the cost of rather stringent time step restrictions. In this work we introduce an implicit numerical method for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The implicit discretization is aimed at bypassing the prohibitive time step restrictions present in flows with stratified media, where one of the materials is particularly dense, or rigid (or both). This is the case for flows of water-air mixtures, air-granular media, or similar high density ratio systems. We will present the novel discretisation approach, which makes extensive use of the remarkable structure of the governing equations in Lagrangian coordinates to find the solution by means of a single implicit discrete wave equation for the pressure field, yielding a symmetric positive definite structure and thus a particularly efficient algorithm. Additionally, we will introduce simple filtering strategies for counteracting the emergence of pressure or density oscillations typically encountered in multimaterial flows, and will present results concerning the robustness, accuracy, and performance of the proposed method, including applications to stratified media with high density and stiffness ratios.</description>

      <title>Solving the Offline and Online Min-Max Problem of Non-smooth Submodular-Concave Functions: A Zeroth-Order Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider max-min and min-max problems with objective functions that are possibly non-smooth, submodular with respect to the minimiser and concave with respect to the maximiser. We investigate the performance of a zeroth-order method applied to this problem. The method is based on the subgradient of the Lov\'asz extension of the objective function with respect to the minimiser and based on Gaussian smoothing to estimate the smoothed function gradient with respect to the maximiser. In expectation sense, we prove the convergence of the algorithm to an $\epsilon$-saddle point in the offline case. Moreover, we show that, in the expectation sense, in the online setting, the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{N\bar{P}_N})$ online duality gap, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $\bar{P}_N$ is the path length of the sequence of optimal decisions. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for gas mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for a gas mixture in the whole space $(x \in \mathbb{R}^3)$ with the potential range of $\gamma \in\left(-3, 1\right]$. Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term. Within the framework of the $L_{x,v}^2-W_{x,v}^{1,\infty}$ interplay established by Guo and Jang \cite{[ininp]Guo2010CMP}, we construct a new weight function to estimate the remainder term in four different cases regarding the potential $\gamma$. Here, the particle masses $m^A, m^B &gt; 0$ and their charges $e^A, e^B$ can be given arbitrarily. This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\infty}$ estimates for the remainder. Therefore, we adopt the framework of vector-valued functions and analyze the velocity decay rate of the operator $K_{M,2,w}^{\alpha,c}$ to eliminate the singularity induced by small parameters in characteristic line iterations. Our results show that the validity time of the solution is $O(\varepsilon^{-y})$, where $y$ is $-\frac{2k-3}{2(2k-1)}$ when $-1 \leq \gamma \leq 1$, and it becomes $-\frac{2k-3}{(1-\gamma)(2k-1)}$, when $-3 &lt; \gamma &lt; -1$. These results possess strong physical realism and can be applied to analyze gas flow dynamics in the daytime ionosphere at high altitudes above the Earth.</description>

      <title>On the structure of prime-detecting quasimodular forms in higher levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Craig, van Ittersum, and Ono conjectured that every prime-detecting quasimodular form of level $1$ is a quasimodular Eisenstein series. This conjecture was proved by Kane--Krishnamoorthy--Lau and by van Ittersum--Mauth--Ono--Singh independently. However, in higher levels, prime-detecting quasimodular forms need not be Eisenstein. Recently, Kane, Krishnamoorthy, and Lau formulated a natural higher level analogue of the above conjecture and proved it by analytic methods. In a similar direction, but via an alternative approach based on the independence of characters of $\ell$-adic Galois representations, we prove that any prime-detecting quasimodular form on $\Gamma_{0}(N)$ belongs to the direct sum of the spaces of quasimodular Eisenstein series and quasimodular oldforms. Moreover, for a quasimodular form $f$ that is not prime-detecting, we give an upper bound for the number of primes $p$ less than $X$ for which the $p$-th Fourier coefficient of a quasimodular form vanishes.</description>

These estimates are further extended to a subclass of holomorphic mappings defined on the unit ball in a complex Banach space and on the unit polydisk in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which, as special cases, yield bounds for the classes of quasi-convex mappings of type $B$.</description>

      <title>Real gamma distribution on analytic bundles of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces four matrix normal distributions extending the separable covariance $ \varPhi \otimes \varPsi$ with potentially variable-level ($ \varPsi$) and/or sample-level ($ \varPhi$) correlations. The joint distribution of sample variances and covariances, leading to the product-moment distribution, is considered when precision matrices admit a specific tensor form. Several well-known results, including the non-central Wishart distribution and normal quadratic forms, now appear as corollaries. Moreover, we propose a conjecture concerning the analytic continuation of the real gamma distribution. By applying these results to the flag varieties, we classify the double flag and the single flag.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation with Quantum Messages for Symmetric Q-ary Pure-State Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) provides a low-complexity alternative to collective measurements for communication over classical--quantum channels. Prior BPQM constructions and density-evolution (DE) analyses have focused on binary alphabets. Here, we generalize BPQM to symmetric q-ary pure-state channels (PSCs) whose output Gram matrix is circulant. For this class, we show that bit-node and check-node combining can be tracked efficiently via closed-form recursions on the Gram-matrix eigenvalues, independent of the particular physical realization of the output states. These recursions yield explicit BPQM unitaries and analytic bounds on the fidelities of the combined channels in terms of the input-channel fidelities. This provides a DE framework for symmetric q-ary PSCs that allows one to estimate BPQM decoding thresholds for LDPC codes and to construct polar codes on these channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust principal component analysis seeks to recover a low-rank matrix from fully observed data with sparse corruptions. A scalable approach fits a low-rank factorization by minimizing the sum of entrywise absolute residuals, leading to a nonsmooth and nonconvex objective. Under standard incoherence conditions and a random model for the corruption support, we study factorizations of the ground-truth rank-$r$ matrix with both factors of rank $r$. With high probability, every such factorization is a Clarke critical point. We also characterize the local geometry: when the factorization rank equals $r$, these solutions are sharp local minima; when it exceeds $r$, they are strict saddle points.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning with Dynamically Refined Edge Weights: A Data-Dependent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to accelerate decentralized optimization by strategically designing the edge weights used in the agent-to-agent message exchanges. We propose a Dynamic Directed Decentralized Gradient (D3GD) framework and show that the proposed data-dependent framework is a practical alternative to the classical directed DGD (Di-DGD) algorithm for learning on directed graphs. To obtain a strategy for edge weights refinement, we derive a design function inspired by the cost-to-go function in a new convergence analysis for Di-DGD. This results in a data-dependent dynamical design for the edge weights. A fully decentralized version of D3GD is developed such that each agent refines its communication strategy using only neighbor's information. Numerical experiments show that D3GD accelerates convergence towards stationary solution by 30-40\% over Di-DGD, and learns edge weights that adapt to data similarity.</description>

      <title>Natural superconvergence points for splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified theory of natural superconvergence points for polynomial spline approximations to second-order elliptic problems. Beginning with the one-dimensional case, we establish that when a point $x_0$ is a local symmetric center of the partition, the numerical error $(u-u_h)^{(s)}(x_0)$ exhibits superconvergence whenever the polynomial degree $k$ and the derivative order $s$ share the same parity. In particular, for the smoothest spline (B-spline) solution, the abundance of superconvergence points allows us to construct asymptotic expansion of the error within the element that fully characterize all superconvergence points, for both function values and derivatives. The theoretical framework is then extended to higher-dimensional settings on simplicial and tensor-product meshes, and the essential conclusions are preserved, with one-dimensional derivatives generalized to mixed derivatives. Numerical experiments demonstrate that superconvergence persists even in extremely localized symmetric regions, revealing that superconvergence points are both readily attainable and follow systematic distribution patterns.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Finite Difference Methods for the Tempered Fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general framework of high-order finite difference (HFD) schemes for the tempered fractional Laplacian (TFL) based on new generating functions obtained from the discrete symbols. Specifically, for sufficiently smooth functions, the resulting discretizations achieve high-order convergence with orders $p=4, 6, 8$. The discrete operators lead to Toeplitz stiffness matrices, allowing efficient matrix-vector multiplications via fast algorithms. Building on these approximations, HFD methods are formulated for solving TFL equations, and their stability and convergence are rigorously analyzed. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: There are many results for explicit expressions about $q$-multiple zeta values or $q$-harmonic sums on $A-\cdots-A$ indices, that is, the indices are the same. Though the way to treat $q$-multiple zeta values unless the indices are the same, it has been successful to get the explicit expression of $q$-harmonic sums on $1-\cdots-1,2,1-\cdots-1$ indices. In this paper, we shall consider more general results when the ratio of indices of $2$ to indices of $1$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ergodic flow, a range of rates of convergence of Birkhoff averages from the maximum rate to an arbitrarily slow rate is realized by choosing the averaging function. For torus windings, the continuity of the averaging functions is ensured. This complements Krengel's classical result on the slow rates of convergence of means for ergodic automorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with step initial condition, in which all particles have distinct types. Our main object of interest is the type of the rightmost particle -- the leader -- at large time $t$. We prove a central limit theorem for this random variable. Somewhat unexpectedly, the problem is closely connected to certain observables of voter and coalescing processes on $\mathbb{Z}$; we therefore derive their asymptotics as well. We also analyze the large-time behavior of a few other related observables, including certain multi-particle ones.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of power-law corrections to Kubo's formula for the Hall current at incommensurate magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-interacting electron gas confined to a two-dimensional crystal by the action of a perpendicular magnetic field; in the one-particle approximation, the dynamics of the system is modelled by a spectrally gapped Bloch-Landau Hamiltonian. No commensurability condition is assumed between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the quantum of magnetic flux. We construct a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state (NEASS) which "dresses" the equilibrium Fermi projection on states below the spectral gap, and models the state of the system after the addition of a weak external electric field of strength $\varepsilon \ll 1$. Having in mind applications to the integer quantum Hall effect, we probe the response of a current operator in the direction transverse to that of the applied electric field, and show that the resulting current density in the NEASS is linear in $\varepsilon$, with no power-law corrections. The linear response coefficient, namely the Hall conductivity, is computed in terms of the equilibrium Fermi projection via the double-commutator formula, in accordance with the prediction from Kubo's linear response theory.
  Our results generalize the methods and findings of [Lett. Math. Phys. 112 (2022), 91] to the setting of uniform magnetic fields with incommensurate magnetic flux per unit cell, and to lattice-periodic perturbation of such magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness and dynamics of two types of reaction--nonlocal diffusion systems under the inhomogeneous spectral fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactio-nonlocal diffusion equations model nonlocal transport and anomalous diffusion by replacing the Laplacian with a fractional power, capturing diffusion mechanisms beyond Brownian motion. We primarily study the semilinear problem \[ \partial_t u + \epsilon^2(-\Delta)_g^\alpha u = \mathcal{N}(u) \] allowing constant inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $u|_{\partial\Omega}=g$. To handle the boundary constraint, we use a harmonic lifting to reformulate the problem as an equivalent homogeneous system with a shifted nonlinearity. Working in \(C_0(\Omega)\), analytic contraction semigroup theory yields the Duhamel formula and quantitative smoothing, implying local wellposedness for locally Lipschitz reactions and a blow-up alternative. The semigroup viewpoint also provides $L^\infty$-contractivity and positivity preservation, which drive pointwise maximum principles and stability bounds. Furthermore, we analyze two prototypes. For the bistable RNDE, we derive an energy dissipation identity and, using a fractional weak maximum principle, obtain an invariant-range property that confines solutions between the two stable steady states. For the nonlocal Gray-Scott system with possibly different fractional diffusion orders, we prove that solutions preserve positivity. Moreover, we identify an explicit \(L^\infty\) invariant set ensuring global boundedness, and derive an eigenfunction-weighted interior \(L^2\) bound. Finally, we perform numerical simulations using a sine pseudospectral discretization and ETDRK4 time-stepping, which the impact of fractional orders on pattern formation, consistent with our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Numerical Methods for Dynamical Low-Rank Approximations of Stochastic Differential Equations -- Part I: Time discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work (Part I), we study three time-discretization procedures of the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) of high-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically, we consider the Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) method for DLRA proposed and analyzed in arXiv:2308.11581v4, which consists of a linear combination of products between deterministic orthonormal modes and stochastic modes, both time-dependent. The first strategy we consider for numerical time-integration is very standard, consisting in a forward discretization in time of both deterministic and stochastic components. Its convergence is proven subject to a time-step restriction dependent on the smallest singular value of the Gram matrix associated to the stochastic modes. Under the same condition on the time-step, this smallest singular value is shown to be always positive, provided that the SDE under study is driven by a non-degenerate noise. The second and the third algorithms, on the other hand, are staggered ones, in which we alternately update the deterministic and the stochastic modes in half steps. These approaches are shown to be more stable than the first one and allow us to obtain convergence results without the aforementioned restriction on the time-step. Computational experiments support theoretical results. In this work we do not consider the discretization in probability, which will be the topic of Part II.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study transversely holomorphic partially hyperbolic flows, i.e. those whose holonomy pseudo-group is given by biholomorphic maps. We prove in the seven-dimensional case that under the assumption that the subcenter distribution is integrable to a flow invariant compact foliation with trivial holonomy, then the flow projects, by a smooth fiber bundle map, to a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth five-dimensional manifold which is, in case of topological transitivity, either $C^\infty$ orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, we show that the double exponential growth condition $\limsup_{n\to\infty}a_n^{1/\phi^n}=\infty$ for a monotonically increasing sequence of positive integers $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, together with the bound $a_n a_{n+1}\geq n^{1+\tau}$, is sufficient for the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(a_n a_{n+1})$ to have an irrational sum; here $\phi$ denotes the golden ratio $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ and $\tau&gt;0$. We also provide a positive generalization to $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(a_n^{w_0}\cdots a_{n+d-1}^{w_{d-1}})$, and a negative result showing that some of its instances are essentially optimal. The original problem was autonomously solved by the AI agent \emph{Aletheia}, powered by Gemini Deep Think, while the remaining material is largely a product of human-AI interactions.</description>

Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and J{\o}rgensen classified positive integer $\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons.
  The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs.</description>

      <title>Classification of low degree del Pezzo orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we classify low degree del Pezzo orbifolds with irreducible boundaries. In order to achieve desired boundaries, we classify low degree curves on low degree del Pezzo surfaces. The notion of Campana orbifolds was introduced by Campana in 2004. A del Pezzo orbifold is a Campana orbifold whose underlying surface is a del Pezzo surface. The classification is elementary applications of adjunction formula, Riemann-Roch theorem, Hodge Index theorem and Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we prove that if $I$ is a right radical and quasi prime ideal in the ring of quaternionic slice regular polynomials, then the symmetrization $\mathbb S_{V_c(I)}$ is an irreducible algebraic set, where $V_c(I)$ is the set of common zeros with commuting components of polynomials in $I$. Combining this fact with the results proved in our previous paper [3], we obtain that for $I$ radical, $V_c(I)$ is irreducible if and only if $I$ is quasi prime.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Sensor Scheduling for Delay-Aware and Stable Remote State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpredictable sensor-to-estimator delays fundamentally distort what matters for wireless remote state estimation: not just freshness, but how delay interacts with sensor informativeness and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a unified, delay-aware framework that models this coupling explicitly and quantifies a delay-dependent information gain, motivating an information-per-joule scheduling objective beyond age of information proxies (AoI). To this end, we first introduce an efficient posterior-fusion update that incorporates delayed measurements without state augmentation, providing a consistent approximation to optimal delayed Kalman updates, and then derive tractable stability conditions ensuring that bounded estimation error is achievable under stochastic, delayed scheduling. This conditions highlight the need for unstable modes to be observable across sensors. Building on this foundation, we cast scheduling as a Markov decision process and develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheduler that learns directly from interaction, requires no prior delay model, and explicitly trades off estimation accuracy, freshness, sensor heterogeneity, and transmission energy through normalized rewards. In simulations with heterogeneous sensors, realistic link-energy models, and random delays, the proposed method learns stably and consistently achieves lower estimation error at comparable energy than random scheduling and strong RL baselines (DQN, A2C), while remaining robust to variations in measurement availability and process/measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Manifold constrained steepest descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Norm-constrained linear minimization oracle (LMO)-based optimizers such as spectral gradient descent and Muon are attractive in large-scale learning, but extending them to manifold-constrained problems is nontrivial and often leads to nested-loop schemes that solve tangent-space subproblems iteratively. We propose \emph{Manifold Constrained Steepest Descent} (MCSD), a single-loop framework for optimization over manifolds that selects a norm-induced steepest-descent direction via an LMO applied to the Riemannian gradient, and then returns to the manifold via projection. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish convergence guarantees for MCSD and a stochastic momentum variant. We further introduce \emph{SPEL}, the spectral-norm specialization of MCSD on the Stiefel manifold, which admits scalable implementations via fast matrix sign computations. Experiments on PCA, orthogonality-constrained CNNs, and manifold-constrained LLM adapter tuning demonstrate improved stability and competitive performance relative to standard Riemannian baselines and existing manifold-aware LMO methods.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Decentralized Self-Regulating Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-regulating random walks (SRRWs) are decentralized token-passing processes on a graph allowing nodes to locally \emph{fork}, \emph{terminate}, or \emph{pass} tokens based only on a return-time \emph{age} statistic. We study SRRWs on a finite connected graph under a lazy reversible walk, with exogenous \emph{trap} deletions summarized by the absorption pressure $\Lambda_{\mathrm{del}}=\sum_{u\in\mathcal P_{\mathrm{trap}}}\zeta(u)\pi(u)$ and a global per-visit fork cap $q$. Using exponential envelopes for return-time tails, we build graph-dependent Laplace envelopes that universally bound the stationary fork intensity of any age-based policy, leading to an effective triggering age $A_{\mathrm{eff}}$. A mixing-based block drift analysis then yields controller-agnostic stability limits: any policy that avoids extinction and explosion must satisfy a \emph{viability} inequality (births can overcome $\Lambda_{\mathrm{del}}$ at low population) and a \emph{safety} inequality (trap deletions plus deliberate terminations dominate births at high population). Under corridor-wise versions of these conditions, we obtain positive recurrence of the population to a finite corridor.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Rotors in Planar Potentials: A Novel type of Superintegrable Mechanical Systems in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superintegrability of rigid body rotors coupled to planar systems. In particular, we study the isotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions, with its (central) force acting on the rotor's center of mass constrained to move in the plane. By including an internal rotational degree of freedom described by a rigid rotor, the resulting planar system possesses three degrees of freedom: two translational and one rotational. When the orbital motion and the internal rotation are tuned to resonance, additional integrals of motion arise, extending the hidden symmetry algebras of the underlying models. For the oscillator, the well-known $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ symmetry algebra can be enlarged by the presence of the rotor, with the conserved momentum $p_{\theta}$ reasonably playing the role of a deformation parameter. These algebraic structures remain to be properly understood, and we hope that this short letter will serve as an invitation to further investigate these interesting models. To close the work, we also examine the oscillator in a vertical plane, in the presence of a rotor, under the effect of a uniform gravitational field, showing that the algebraic structure persists as a translated version of the isotropic case, as expected. In all these settings, the extended dynamics admits five functionally independent integrals, thereby confirming maximal superintegrability. Our simple yet nontrivial results suggest that rigid-body rotors provide a natural mechanism for generating new families of (resonant) superintegrable systems, along with their associated symmetry algebras, an outcome that aligns with the main objective of this work.</description>

Abstract: The log-concavity of cluster variables of type $A_n$ and cluster monomials of type $A_2$ was established by Chen-Huang-Sun. It is still a conjecture for the cluster monomials of higher rank. In this paper, we prove the log-concavity and unimodality of the cluster monomials of type $A_3$, a substantially more intricate case. Moreover, we refine and extend this conjecture by considering the unimodality and the strongly isomorphism of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sobolev Spaces and Distributional Spectral Theory for Generalized Aging Operators via Transmutation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral analysis of operators in heterogeneous and aging media typically requires a functional framework that extends beyond the standard Hilbertian setting. In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\mathcal{S}_{\psi,\omega}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\mathcal{S}'_{\psi,\omega}$, ensuring that the underlying Fr\'echet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $\delta_{\psi,\omega}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{\psi,\omega}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \le C \omega(t)^{-1} \|u\|_{H^s_{\psi,\omega}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $\omega$. This framework provides a unified geometric characterization of several fractional regimes, including the Hadamard and Riemann-Liouville cases, within a single operator-theoretic architecture.</description>

Abstract: We quantitatively study the speed of convergence of geodesic Lie groups to their metric limits. For nilpotent geodesic Lie groups, we give estimates on the difference of the original metrics and the asymptotic metrics, while for general geodesic Lie groups, we give similar estimates for the difference of the original metrics and the tangent metrics. In both settings, our results sharpen existing bounds in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of computing the set of diagonal transversal gates fixing a CSS code. We determine the logical actions of the gates as well as the groups of transversal gates that induce non-trivial logical gates and logical identities. We explicitly declare the set of equations defining the groups, a key advantage and differentiator of our approach. We compute the complete set of transversal stabilizers and transversal gates for any CSS code arising from monomial codes, a family that includes decreasing monomial codes and polar codes. As a consequence, we recover and extend some results in the literature on CSS-T codes, triorthogonal codes, and divisible codes.</description>

      <title>On the Visibility category of the Shafarevich--Tate group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a nontrivial element $\sigma$ of its Shafarevich--Tate group, we introduce the Visualization category $\mathcal{V}(E; \sigma)$ of abelian varieties that ``visualize'' $\sigma$ in the sense of Mazur, and we study minimal objects in this category. In particular, we show that there can be several minimal visualizing abelian varieties of different dimensions, answering a question of Mazur. In the case that $\sigma$ has order $2$ or $3$, we revisit two constructions of visualizing abelian varieties, due to Agashe and Stein, and Cremona and Mazur. We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $\sigma$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization. For order $3$ elements we apply our algorithmic construction to Fisher's database of such elements, and obtain computational evidence that, in the majority of cases, the Cremona--Mazur construction yields a minimal visualization.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple representation for isotropic spherical random fields and we discuss how it allows to discuss different notions of sparsity under isotropy. We also show how a suitable construction of sparse fields can mimic well the angular power spectrum and the polyspectra of some popular non-Gaussian fields, at the same time allowing for computationally efficient simulation algorithms. Using related ideas we also show how it is possible to obtain sparse approximations of spherical random fields which preserve isotropy, thus addressing an issue which has been raised in the Cosmological literature.</description>

      <title>Wide neural networks with general weights: convergence rate and explicit dependence on the hyper-parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Stein's method techniques introduced by Chatterjee (2008) and further extended by Kasprzak and Peccati (2022) and by Lachi\`eze-Rey and Peccati (2017), we derive novel quantitative bounds on the convergence in distribution of feed-forward fully connected neural networks (with Lipschitz activation functions) towards Gaussian processes, as the hidden layer width $n$ tends to infinity. We consider networks initialized with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) weights possessing sufficiently many finite moments, and i.i.d. Gaussian biases independent of the weights. Specifically, when the network is evaluated at a single input, we obtain convergence rates of order $O(n^{-1/2})$ in both total variation and Wasserstein distances. When evaluated at a general finite collection of inputs, we establish bounds of the same order in terms of the convex distance. All bounds are given in explicit and computable form. As a consequence of our estimates, we also deduce a novel convergence result in the regime where the depth of the neural network increases simultaneously with the width $n$, up to order $O\big((\log_2 n)^{1/3}\big)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLT in the infinite width/depth limit holding for general (nonlinear) Lipschitz activation functions and non-Gaussian weight distributions. Our analysis yields several results of independent interest, including: (i) an explicit lower bound on the determinant of the limiting covariance matrix and (ii) new advances in Stein's method, both for the one-dimensional Stein's equation associated with the square of a Lipschitz function and for the multivariate Stein's equation associated with the tensor product of a Lipschitz function with itself.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of JReject of a class of modules as a generalization of the notion of reject of a class of modules. We also introduce the notion of J-torsionless modules and give a characterization of regularity on the basis of the J-torsionless condition. A necessary and sufficient condition on $R$ is also given for every cyclic module over $R$ to be J-torsionless. Finally, we give a description of self-injective rings over which every module is J-torsionless.</description>

      <title>New examples of non-Fourier-Mukai exact functors via non-isomorphic octahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a triangulated category $\mathscr S$ that admits a full and strong exceptional sequence of three objects with one-dimensional Hom spaces. We show that the isomorphism classes of exact functors from $\mathscr S$ to another triangulated category $\mathscr T$ are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of octahedra in $\mathscr T$ satisfying a natural condition. As an application, we construct an exact functor from $\mathscr S$ to $\mathbf D^b(\Bbbk[x]\text{-}\mathrm{mod})$ that does not admit a dg lift. This provides an explicit example of a non-Fourier-Mukai exact functor between $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^2)$ and $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^1)$.</description>

      <title>Seymour's Second Neighbourhood Conjecture for Oriented Graphs of Order at Most Seven and Split-Twin Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $D$, let $N_1^+(v)$ denote the out-neighborhood of a vertex $v$, and let $N_2^+(v)$ be the set of vertices reachable from $v$ by a directed path of length two that are neither out-neighbors of $v$ nor equal to $v$. The Second Neighborhood Conjecture of Seymour asserts that every oriented graph contains a vertex $v$ with $|N_2^+(v)| \ge |N_1^+(v)|$. Equivalently, if one defines the second neighborhood invariant \[ \Delta(D)=\max_{v\in V(D)}\bigl(|N_2^+(v)|-|N_1^+(v)|\bigr), \] the conjecture asserts that $\Delta(D)\ge 0$ for all oriented graphs.
  We prove by exhaustive computation that $\Delta(D)\ge 0$ for every oriented graph on at most seven vertices. We also introduce a local graph operation, called a split--twin extension, and prove that it preserves the inequality $\Delta(D)\ge 0$. Consequently, $\Delta(D)\ge 0$ holds for infinite inductively generated families of oriented graphs.</description>

      <title>On minimal graphs for hamiltonian groups and their fixing set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite non-abelian group $H$ is hamiltonian if all of its subgroups are normal. We compute the minimal orders of graphs having a hamiltonian group as their automorphism group. The fixing number of a graph $\Gamma$ is the minimum cardinality of a subset $S$ of $V(\Gamma)$ such that the stabilizer of $S$ is trivial. For a given finite group $G$, the fixing set is defined as the set comprising all possible fixing numbers of graphs having group $G$ as their automorphism groups. We determine the fixing sets corresponding to finite hamiltonian groups.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Enumeration of Subclasses of Level-$2$ Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the enumeration of seven subclasses of level-$2$ phylogenetic networks under various planarity and structural constraints, including terminal planar, tree-child, and galled networks. We derive their exponential generating functions, recurrence relations, and asymptotic formulas. Specifically, we show that the number of networks of size $n$ in each class follows: \[ N_n \sim c \cdot n^{n-1} \cdot \gamma^n, \] where $c$ is a class-specific constant and $\gamma$ is the corresponding growth rate. Our results reveal that being terminal planar can significantly reduce the growth rate of general level-2 networks, but has only a minor effect on the growth rates of tree-child and galled level-2 networks. Notably, the growth rate of 3.83 for level-$2$ terminal planar galled tree-child networks is remarkably close to the rate of 2.94 for level-$1$ networks.</description>

      <title>On the minimum doubly resolving set problem in line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph $G$ with at least three vertices, let $d_G(u,v)$ denote the distance between vertices $u,v\in V(G)$. A subset $S\subseteq V$ is called a doubly resolving set (DRS) of $G$ if for any two distinct vertices $u, v \in V(G)$, there exists a pair $\{x,y\}\subseteq S$ such that $d_G(u,x)-d_G(u,y)\neq d_G(v,x)-d_G(v,y)$. This paper studies the minimum cardinality of a DRS in the line graph of $G$, denoted by $\Psi(L(G))$. First, we prove that computing $\Psi(L(G))$ is NP-hard, even when $G$ is a bipartite graph. Second, we establish that $\lceil \log_2 (1+\Delta(G))\rceil \le \Psi(L(G)) \le |V(G)| - 1$ holds for all $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G)$, and show that both inequalities are tight. Finally, we determine the exact value of $\Psi(L(G))$ provided $G$ is a tree.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of nontrivial stationary solution and constant equilibrium point of reaction-diffusion neural networks with time delays under Dirichlet zero boundary value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique, design of state-dependent switching laws, a fixed point theorem and variational methods are employed to derive the existence and the unique existence results of globally exponentially stable (positive) stationary solution of delayed reaction-diffusion cell neural networks under Dirichlet zero boundary value, including the global stability criteria in the classical meaning. Next, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the global stability invariance of ordinary differential systems under the influence of diffusions. New theorems show that the diffusion is a double-edged sword in judging the stability of diffusion systems. Besides, an example is constructed to illuminate that any non-zero constant equilibrium point must be not in the phase plane of dynamic system under Dirichlet zero boundary value, or it must lead to a contradiction. Next, under Lipschitz assumptions on active function, another example is designed to prove that the small diffusion effect will cause the essential change of the phase plane structure of the dynamic behavior of the delayed neural networks via a Saddle point theorem. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the feasibility of the proposed methods. It is worth mentioning that some interesting mathematical problems are originally put forward in the last chapter.</description>

      <title>New inequalities related to sums of $L^p$ functions in connection with Carbery's problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbery (2006) proposed novel estimates for the $L^p$ norm of a sum of two nonnegative measurable functions. Subsequently, Carlen, Frank, Ivanisvili and Lieb (2018) provided stronger bounds, which Ivanisvili and Mooney (2020) further refined to achieve estimates that are, in a certain sense, optimal. Continuing this line of research, the present work establishes new upper and lower bounds for the range \(p\in(1,\infty)\). Carbery also asked under what conditions on a sequence \((f_j)\) of nonnegative measurable functions the inequality \(\sum \|f_j\|_p^p &lt; \infty\) implies that \(\sum f_j \in L^p\). Ivanisvili and Mooney (2020) resolved this question for \(p\in[1,2]\), and the present work proposes an answer for \(p\in[2,\infty)\).</description>

      <title>A data-based image representation for continuous-time LTI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a numerically stable method to obtain an image representation of an unknown linear system only from data, leveraging a continuous-time version of Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma. We propose a data-based representation that, unlike previous approaches, avoids solving differential-algebraic equations and uses derivatives approximated by algebraic differentiators. Our image-based formulation significantly reduces the complexity of the data-driven representation by eliminating redundant degrees of freedom and thus reducing the number of unknown quantities to be identified. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, even in the presence of severe measurement disturbances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified formulation for higher gauge theory using generalized forms, encompassing higher connections, curvatures, and gauge transformations. We begin by developing the calculus of generalized forms valued in higher algebras and groups, including the associated higher Maurer--Cartan forms and equations. Using generalized forms of types N = 1, 2, we then provide a complete description of higher gauge structures. Finally, we derive the action functionals for higher Chern--Simons and Yang--Mills theories as applications of the formalism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a primal hybrid finite element method for the approximation of linear elasticity problems, posed in terms of displacement, an auxiliary pressure field, and a Lagrange multiplier related to the traction. We develop a general analysis for the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the discrete problem, which is applied to the construction of stable approximation spaces on triangular and quadrilateral meshes. The use of these spaces lead to optimal convergence orders, resulting in a locking-free method capable of providing robust approximations for nearly incompressible problems. Finally, we propose a strategy for recovering the stress field from the hybrid solution by solving element-wise sub-problems. The resulting stress approximation is $H(\mathrm{div})$-conforming, locally equilibrated, weakly symmetric, and robust to locking.</description>

      <title>Multistatic anisotropic travel-time as a tensor tomography problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel-time imaging problems seek to reconstruct an image of reflectivity of a scene by measuring travel time (and amplitude, phase) of electromagnetic or acoustic signals, such as radar and sonar. Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields.</description>

We demonstrate that there exists a constructive algorithm for solving the Cauchy problem. We then show that for some initial distributions of states, the solution can be found explicitly. We also discuss how a model with a discrete number of hidden states can be approximated by a model with continuously distributed states.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid semi-Lagrangian Flow Mapping Approach for Vlasov Systems: Combining Iterative and Compositional Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov--Poisson equation that combines the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method with the Characteristic Mapping Method (CMM). Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties.</description>

Abstract: We study semilinear non-local elliptic problems driven by spectral-type operators of the form $\psi(-L_{|D})$ in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonhomogeneous boundary condition. Here $\psi$ is a Bernstein function satisfying a weak scaling condition at infinity, and $L_{|D}$ is the generator of a killed L\'evy process. This general framework covers and extends the theory of the interpolated fractional Laplacian. A key novelty in this setting is the analysis of the nonhomogeneous boundary condition formulated in terms of the Poisson potential with respect to the $d-1$ Hausdorff measure on $\partial D$. We establish sharp boundary estimates for Green and Poisson potentials, introduce a weak $L^1$ trace-like boundary operator, and provide existence results for solutions under quite general nonlinearities, including sign-changing and non-monotone cases. The methodology combines stochastic process techniques, potential theory, and spectral analysis, and expresses the boundary behavior of the solution in terms of the renewal function and the distance to the boundary, suggesting a possible unified treatment of semilinear boundary problems in non-local settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Outrunning the Omega Clock: A Singular Control Problem for Dividend Optimisation with Ruin and Time-in-Distress Default</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the classical dividend problem by incorporating a novel, path-dependent mechanism of firm default. In the traditional framework, ruin occurs when the surplus process first reaches zero. In contrast, default in our model may also arise when the surplus spends an excessive amount of time below a distress threshold, even without ever hitting zero. This occupation-time-based default criterion captures financial distress more realistically, as prolonged periods of low liquidity or capitalisation may trigger regulatory intervention or operational failure. The resulting optimisation problem is formulated as a new singular stochastic control problem with discontinuous state-dependent discounting and killing. We provide a complete analytical solution via a bespoke sequential guess-and-verify method and identify three distinct classes of optimal dividend strategies corresponding to different parameter regimes of the dual-ruin structure. Notably, for certain distress thresholds, the optimal policy features disconnected action and inaction regions. We further show that, unlike in the classical dividend problem, higher effective discounting induced by occupation time below a distress level can lead to delayed, rather than earlier, dividend payments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel methods approximate nonlinear maps in a data-driven manner by projecting the target map onto a finite-dimensional Hilbert space called the solution space. Traditionally, this space is a subspace of a fixed ambient reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), determined solely by the chosen kernel and the dataset, whose elements identify the basis elements. Consequently, the projection operator underlying the kernel method depends on the loss function, the dataset, and the choice of ambient RKHS. In this study, we consider kernel methods whose solution spaces also depend on learnable parameters that are independent of the dataset. The resulting methods can be viewed as variable projection operators that depend on the loss function, the dataset, and the new learnable parameters instead of a fixed RKHS. This work has two main contributions. First, we propose an efficient approximation of kernels associated with infinite-dimensional RKHSs, commonly used to reduce the solution-space dimension for large datasets. Second, we construct fixed-dimensional, parameter-dependent solution spaces that enable highly efficient kernel models suitable for large-scale problems without the need to approximate kernels of infinite-dimensional RKHSs. Our novel family of adaptive kernel methods generalizes earlier approaches, including Random Fourier Features, and we demonstrate their effectiveness through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On Diagonalizable Systems with Random Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagonalizability plays an important role in the analysis and design of multivariable systems. A structured matrix is called structurally diagonalizable if almost all of its numerical realizations, obtained by assigning real values to its free entries, are diagonalizable. Structural diagonalizability is useful for the verification and optimization of various structural system properties. In this paper, we study the asymptotic probability distribution of structural diagonalizability for structured systems whose system matrices are represented by directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs. Leveraging a recently established graph-theoretic characterization of structural diagonalizability, we analyze the distribution of structurally diagonalizable graphs under different edge-density regimes. For dense graphs, we prove that the system is almost always structurally diagonalizable. For graphs of medium density, we derive tight upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic probability of structural diagonalizability. For extremely sparse graphs, we show that this probability approaches 0. The theoretical results are validated through extensive numerical simulations with varying numbers of vertices and connection probabilities.</description>

      <title>On sample complexity for covariance estimation via the unadjusted Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of strongly log-concave smooth distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.</description>

      <title>Sweedler Duality for BiHom-associative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that ordinary linear duality does not in general produce a coalgebra structure from an infinite-dimensional algebra, we develop a Sweedler-type finite dual construction for BiHom-associative algebras. For a BiHom-algebra $(G,\mu,\alpha,\beta)$ over a field, we define its Sweedler dual $G^{\circ}\subseteq G^{*}$ as the subspace of linear functionals annihilating a finite-codimensional BiHom-ideal of $G$. We prove that $G^{\circ}$ carries a natural BiHom-coalgebra structure whose comultiplication is the restriction of $\mu^{*}$, and that BiHom-algebra morphisms induce BiHom-coalgebra morphisms on Sweedler duals. We further extend this construction to right BiHom-modules, obtaining right BiHom-comodules over $G^{\circ}$ under a surjectivity assumption on the twisting map $\beta$. The Hom and classical cases are recovered by the specializations $\alpha=\beta$ and $\alpha=\beta=\mathrm{Id}$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a formalization of spherically complete spaces, which is a fundamental notion in non-archimedean functional analysis. This work includes the equivalent definitions of spherically complete spaces, their basic properties, examples and non-examples such as the field $\mathbf{C}_p$ of $p$-adic complex numbers. As applications, we formalize the Birkhoff-James orthogonality, Hahn-Banach extension theorem and the spherical completion for non-archimedean Banach spaces.

      <title>A reduced basis method for parabolic PDEs based on a space-time least squares formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a POD-greedy reduced basis method for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), based on the least squares space-time formulation proposed in [Hinze, Kahle, Stahl, A least-squares space-time approach for parabolic equations, 2023, arXiv:2305.03402] that assumes only minimal regularity. We extend this approach to the parameter-dependent case. The corresponding variational formulation then is based on a parameter-dependent, symmetric, uniformly coercive, and continuous bilinear form. We apply the reduced basis method to this formulation, following the well-developed techniques for parameterized coercive problems, as seen e.g. in reduced basis methods for parameterized elliptic PDEs. We present an offline-online decomposition and provide certification with absolute and relative error bounds. The performance of the method is demonstrated using selected numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a stochastic linear quadratic (LQ, for short) control problem with a recursive cost functional. It involves BSDEs in $L^1$ whose well-posedness is a subtle issue. A suitable framework has been adopted so that the corresponding LQ problem is correctly formulated. Open-loop and closed-loop solvability of such an LQ problem have been investigated and characterized by the solvability of an FBSDE and that of Riccati differential equation.</description>

      <title>Subjective Distortion: Achievability and Outer Bounds for Distortion Functions with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some rate-distortion-type problems, the required fidelity of information is affected by past actions. As a result, the distortion function depends not only on the instantaneous distortion between a source symbol and its representation symbol, but also on past representations. In this paper, we give a formal definition of this problem and introduce both inner (achievable) and outer bounds on the rate-distortion tradeoff. We also discuss convexification of the problem, which makes it easier to find bounds. Problems of this type arise in biological information processing, as well as in recommendation engines; we provide an example applied to a simplified biological information processing problem.</description>

Abstract: We define a bona fide rough path solution for the Navier-Stokes equation with an additional rough transport term, and show that the SPDE on the three-dimensional torus driven by a fractional Brownian motion on $H^\sigma$ has solutions characterised as the effective limits of a slow/fast system. We further show that this rough path solution is equivalent to the widely used incremental notion of solution (the unbounded rough driver formulation), demonstrating broader applicability to other nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap of Metropolis Algorithms for Non-smooth Distributions under Isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metropolis algorithms are classical tools for sampling from target distributions, with broad applications in statistics and scientific computing. Their convergence speed is governed by the spectral gap of the associated Markov operator. Recently, Andrieu et al. (2024) derived the first explicit bounds for the spectral gap of Random-Walk Metropolis when the target distribution is smooth and strongly log-concave. However, existing literature rarely discuss non-smooth targets. In this work, we derive explicit spectral gap bounds for the Random-Walk Metropolis and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms over a broad class of non-smooth distributions. Moreover, combining our analysis with a recent result in Goyal et al. (2025), we extend these bounds to targets satisfying a Poincare or log-Sobolev inequality, beyond the strongly log-concave setting. Our theoretical results are further supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations by minimizing residuals of monotone discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive sufficient conditions under which residual minimization yields well-posed discrete solutions for nonlinear equations defined by monotone finite--difference discretizations. Our analysis is motivated by the challenge of solving fully nonlinear Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equations in high dimensions by means of a Neural Network, which is trained by minimizing residuals arising from monotone discretizations of the Hamiltonian. While classical theory ensures that consistency and monotonicity imply convergence to the viscosity solution, treating these discrete systems as optimization problems introduces new analytical hurdles: solvability and the uniqueness of local minima do not follow from monotonicity alone.
  By establishing the well--posedness of these optimization--based solvers, our framework enables the adaptation of Level Set Methods to high--dimensional settings, unlocking new capabilities in applications such as high--dimensional segmentation and interface tracking. Finally, we observe that these arguments extend almost directly to degenerate elliptic or parabolic PDEs on graphs equipped with monotone graph Laplacians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We resolve a question posed by Min\'a\v{c}-Rogelstad-T\^an. We relate the Zassenhaus and the lower central series of pro-$p$ groups under a torsion-freeness condition.
  We also study graph products of (pro-$p$) groups under natural assumptions. In particular, we compute their graded Lie algebras associated with the previous filtrations, as well as their cohomology over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Our approach relies on various filtrations of amalgamated products, as studied in Leoni's PhD thesis. Explicit examples are provided using the Koszul property.
  As a concrete application, we compute the cohomology over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and the graded Lie algebras associated with the filtrations of graph products of fundamental groups of surfaces. These groups furnish new examples satisfying the torsion-freeness condition, which arises in the question of Min\'a\v{c}-Rogelstad-T\^an.</description>

      <title>A novel Krylov subspace method for approximating Fr\'echet derivatives of large-scale matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel Krylov subspace method for approximating $L_f(A, E) \vc{b}$, the matrix-vector product of the Fr\'echet derivative $L_f(A, E)$ of a large-scale matrix function $f(A)$ in direction $E$, a task that arises naturally in the sensitivity analysis of quantities involving matrix functions, such as centrality measures for networks. It also arises in the context of gradient-based methods for optimization problems that feature matrix functions, e.g., when fitting an evolution equation to an observed solution trajectory. In principle, the well-known identity \[
  f\left( \begin{bmatrix}
  A &amp; E \\ 0 &amp; A
  \end{bmatrix} \right) \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\ \vc{b}
  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
  L_f(A, E) \vc{b} \\ f(A) \vc{b}
  \end{bmatrix}, \] allows one to directly apply any standard Krylov subspace method, such as the Arnoldi algorithm, to address this task. However, this comes with the major disadvantage that the involved block triangular matrix has unfavorable spectral properties, which impede the convergence analysis and, to a certain extent, also the observed convergence. To avoid these difficulties, we propose a novel modification of the Arnoldi algorithm that aims at better preserving the block triangular structure. In turn, this allows one to bound the convergence of the modified method by the best polynomial approximation of the derivative $f^\prime$ on the numerical range of $A$. Several numerical experiments illustrate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical computing exploits unconventional physical substrates to overcome limitations such as the high energy consumption inherent in digital computation. However, intrinsic noise and temporal fluctuations (e.g., oscillations) generally deteriorate computational performance. Here, we propose ensemble reservoir computing (ERC), a novel framework that employs ensemble averaging of spatially multiplexed systems to achieve robust information processing despite noise and temporal fluctuations. First, we prove that ensemble averaging in ERC eliminates temporal fluctuations and noise from dynamical states under certain conditions, thereby restoring computational performance to its noise-free level. Next, we show that ERC not only removes the noise and fluctuations but also actively exploits the computational capabilities that conventional reservoir computing (RC) leaves unutilized. This computational enhancement is demonstrated across diverse dynamical systems (e.g., periodic, chaotic, and strange-nonchaotic systems), in which ERC outperforms conventional RC. Finally, using energy-efficient spin-torque oscillators (STOs), we demonstrate that ERC maintains high performance even under realistic conditions, in which noise and temporal fluctuations coexist: STOs with ERC achieved 99\% accuracy on an error detection test, where conventional STO reservoir with linear regression only shows a chance level performance, highlighting ERC's robustness and performance gains for physical systems.</description>

      <title>On positive automorphisms of algebras of operators on atomic Archimedean vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an Archimedean vector lattice. We investigate subalgebras of $\mathscr{L}(X)$ consisting of regular operators that contain all rank-one operators of the form $a \otimes \varphi_b$, where $a$ and $b$ are atoms of $X$ and $\varphi_b$ denotes the coordinate functional associated with $b$. Our main result shows that every positive automorphism of such a subalgebra contained in $\mathscr{L}(c_{00}(\Lambda))$, is necessarily spatial, meaning that it is implemented by a transformation of the form $$ T \mapsto P D\, T\, D^{-1} P^{-1}, $$ where $P$ is a permutation operator and $D$ is a positive diagonal operator. An important tool for this analysis-one that is also of independent interest-is the Kakutani representation theorem, which we use to establish that every finite-dimensional vector subspace of $X$ is order closed.</description>

      <title>Identifiability in Graphical Discrete Lyapunov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study discrete Lyapunov models, which consist of steady-state distributions of first-order vector autoregressive models. The parameter matrix of such a model encodes a directed graph whose vertices correspond to the components of the random vector. This combinatorial framework naturally allows for cycles in the graph structure. We focus on the fundamental problem of identifying the entries of the parameter matrix. In contrast to the classical setting, we assume non-Gaussian error terms, which allows us to use the higher-order cumulants of the model. In this setup, we show generic identifiability for directed acyclic graphs with self-loops at each vertex and show how to express the parameters as a rational function of the cumulants. Furthermore, we establish local identifiability for all directed graphs containing self loops at each vertex and no isolated vertices. Finally, we provide first results on the defining equations of the models, showing model equivalence for certain graphs and paving the way towards structure learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness uniquely (up to scaling) exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this short research note is to present some results about a conjecture of Barker and Gelvin claiming that any source algebra of a block of a finite group has the unit group containing a basis stabilised by the left and right actions of the defect group. We obtain some reduction theorems for the existence of stable unital basis in source algebras of block algebras.

      <title>ZOBA: An Efficient Single-loop Zeroth-order Bilevel Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems consist of minimizing a value function whose evaluation depends on the solution of an inner optimization problem. These problems are typically tackled using first-order methods that require computing the gradient of the value function ({\it the hypergradient}). In several practical settings, however, first-order information is unavailable ({\it zeroth-order setting}), rendering these methods inapplicable. Finite-difference methods provide an alternative by approximating hypergradients using function evaluations along a set of directions. Nevertheless, such surrogates are notoriously expensive, and existing finite-difference bilevel methods rely on two-loop algorithms that are poorly parallelizable. In this work, we propose ZOBA, the first finite-difference single-loop algorithm for bilevel optimization. Our method leverages finite-difference hypergradient approximations based on delayed information to eliminate the need for nested loops. We analyze the proposed algorithm and establish convergence rates in the non-convex setting, achieving a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(p(d + p)^2\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $p$ and $d$ denote the dimension of inner and outer spaces respectively, which is better than prior approaches based on Hessian approximation. We further introduce and analyze HF-ZOBA, a Hessian-free variant that yields additional complexity improvements. Finally, we corroborate our findings with numerical experiments on synthetic functions and a real-world black-box task in adversarial machine learning. Our results show that our methods achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art techniques while requiring less computation time.</description>

      <title>The Leibniz adjunction in homotopy type theory, with an application to simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory and equips types with a notion of directed morphisms. A Segal type is defined to be a type in which these directed morphisms can be composed. We show that all higher coherences can be stated and derived if simplicial type theory is taken to be homotopy type theory with a postulated interval type. In technical terms, this means that if a type has unique fillers for $(2,1)$-horns, it has unique fillers for all inner $(n,k)$-horns. This generalizes a result of Riehl and Shulman for the case $n = 3, k \in \{1, 2\}$. Our main technical tool is the Leibniz adjunction: the pushout-product is left adjoint to the pullback-hom in the wild category of types. While this adjunction is well known for ordinary categories, it is much more involved for higher categories, and the fact that it can be proved for the wild category of types (a higher category without stated higher coherences) is non-trivial. We make profitable use of the equivalence between the wild category of maps and that of families. We have formalized the results in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of $p$-K\"ahler structures on two classes of complex manifolds: on quasi-regular fibrations, with particular emphasis on complex homogeneous spaces, and on reductive Lie groups endowed with invariant complex structures. In the latter setting, we construct non-regular complex structures on the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{sl}(2m-1,\mathbb{R})$ for $m \ge 2$ and show that these structures admit compatible balanced metrics, providing new explicit examples of balanced manifolds.</description>

      <title>Center of the affine $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level and pseudo-differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the center of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|1}$ at the critical level is generated by the coefficients in the expansion of the pseudo-differential operator $(\partial_z-u_1(z))\cdots (\partial_z-u_n(z))(\partial_z+u_{n+1}(z))^{-1}$ taking values in the Cartan subalgebra. This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case.
  The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level.</description>

      <title>Unique Continuation Property for Stochastic Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental and surprising phenomenon in the theory of stochastic wave equations: the restoration of the unique continuation property (UCP) across characteristic hypersurfaces, a property that is known to fail generically in the deterministic setting. We prove that if a solution to a linear stochastic wave equation vanishes on one side of a characteristic surface $\Gamma$, then it must vanish in a full neighborhood of any point on $\Gamma$, provided the stochastic diffusion coefficient is non-degenerate. This result stands in sharp contrast to the classical H\"ormander-type counterexamples for deterministic waves.
  Furthermore, we extend the UCP to equations with non-homogeneous stochastic sources and establish a global unique continuation result from the interior of an arbitrarily narrow characteristic cone. Our proofs rely on a novel stochastic Carleman estimate, where the It\^o diffusion term introduces a crucial positive energy contribution that is absent in deterministic models.
  These findings demonstrate a qualitative difference between deterministic and stochastic hyperbolic dynamics and open new avenues for control theory and inverse problems in stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>When to Match: A Cost-Balancing Principle for Dynamic Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching platforms, from ridesharing to food delivery to competitive gaming, face a fundamental operational dilemma: match agents immediately to minimize waiting costs, or delay to exploit the efficiency gains of thicker markets. Yet computing optimal policies is generally intractable, sophisticated algorithms often rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, and common heuristics lack worst-case performance guarantees. We formulate a versatile framework for multi-sided matching with general state-dependent cost structures and non-stationary arrival dynamics. Central to our approach is a cost-balancing principle: match when accumulated waiting cost reaches a calibrated proportion of instantaneous matching cost. This equilibrium condition emerges from fluid-limit analysis and motivates a simple, adaptive Cost-Balancing (CB) algorithm requiring no distributional assumptions. We prove that CB achieves a competitive ratio of $(1+\sqrt{\Gamma})$ under adversarial arrivals, where $\Gamma$ quantifies economies of scale, guaranteeing cost within a constant factor of the offline optimum. In contrast, standard greedy and threshold policies can incur unbounded costs in adversarial scenarios. We further establish a universal lower bound of $(\sqrt{5}+1)/2$ (the golden ratio), quantifying the fundamental price of uncertainty in online matching. Experiments on game matchmaking and real-world food delivery data demonstrate practical effectiveness, with CB consistently outperforming industry-standard heuristics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Privacy of Sequential Data Releases Under Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility remains an active area of research. Our contribution is motivated by two observations. First, privacy mechanisms developed for one-time data release cannot straightforwardly be extended to sequential releases. Second, practical databases are likely to be useful to multiple distinct parties. Furthermore, we can not rule out the possibility of data sharing between parties. With utility in mind, we formulate a privacy-utility trade-off problem to adaptively tackle sequential data requests made by different, potentially colluding entities. We consider both expected distortion and mutual information as measures to quantify utility, and use mutual information to measure privacy. We assume an attack model whereby illicit data sharing, which we call collusion, can occur between data receivers. We develop an adaptive algorithm for data releases that makes use of a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. We show that the resulting data releases are optimal when expected distortion quantifies utility, and locally optimal when mutual information quantifies utility. Finally, we discuss how our findings may extend to applications in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Learning of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Growth estimate for the number of crossing limit cycles in planar piecewise polynomial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem, we extend some main developments obtained for Hilbert's number in the polynomial setting to the piecewise polynomial context. Specifically, we study the growth of the maximum number of crossing limit cycles in planar piecewise polynomial vector fields of degree $n$, denoted by $H_c(n)$. The best previously known general lower bound is $H_c(n)\geq 2n - 1$. In this work, we show that $H_c(n)$ grows at least as fast as $n^2/4.$ Furthermore, we prove that $H_c(n)$ is strictly increasing whenever it is finite, and that in such cases this maximum can be realized by piecewise polynomial systems whose crossing limit cycles are all hyperbolic. Finally, for the more restrictive class of piecewise polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields, we adapt the recursive construction of Christopher and Lloyd to demonstrate that the corresponding maximal number of crossing limit cycles, denoted by $\widehat{H}_c(n)$, grows at least as fast as $n\log n/(2\log 2)$, thereby improving previously established linear growth estimate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that among all unit-speed paths, a straight line minimises the expected escape time from a ball in $\mathbf{R}^n$, solving the min-mean variant of Bellman's Lost in a Forest problem for ball-shaped forests. The proof uses the Kneser--Poulsen conjecture in the plane, together with results on polygonal chain straightening in higher dimensions. Moreover, we calculate this minimal escape time by deriving the expected linear distance to the boundary of a ball in $n$ dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study "polync varieties", whose singularities are locally products of normal crossing (nc) singularities. We introduce the notion of d-semistability of such varieties, and generalize work of Friedman and Kawamata-Namikawa to address the smoothability of d-semistable, K-trivial, polync varieties. These results are applications of recent breakthroughs on the logarithmic Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem, due to Chan-Leung-Ma and Felten-Filip-Ruddat. We generalize the combinatorial description of Kulikov models for K3 surfaces to the setting of a multiparameter base and describe some interesting examples.</description>

      <title>Quotient geometry of tensor ring decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential geometries derived from tensor decompositions have been extensively studied and provided the foundations for a variety of efficient numerical methods. Despite the practical success of the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, its intrinsic geometry remains less understood, primarily due to the underlying ring structure and the resulting nontrivial gauge invariance. We establish the quotient geometry of TR decomposition by imposing full-rank conditions on all unfolding matrices of the core tensors and capturing the gauge invariance. Additionally, the results can be extended to the uniform TR decomposition, where all core tensors are identical. Numerical experiments validate the developed geometries via tensor ring completion tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Mullin's prime-generating procedures to produce sequences of primes lying in given residue classes. In particular we study the sequences generated by cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_m(cx)$ for suitable $c\in\mathbb{Z}$. Under the Extended Riemann Hypothesis in general and unconditionally for some moduli, we show that the analogue of the second Euclid--Mullin sequence omits infinitely many primes $\equiv1\pmod{m}$. We further show unconditionally that at least one prime is omitted for infinitely many $m$. This generalises work of the first author for $m=1$ and the second author for $m=2^k$.</description>

      <title>On Gautschi &amp; Stirling Identities, Asymptotics and Inequalities for the Pi (or Gamma) Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two-sided bounds for a class of Stirling-type asymptotic formulas for piecewise logarithmic interpolations of the pi function, and hence also for the factorials and the gamma functions. The bounds are derived by first proving some integral identity versions of Gautschi's inequality and a class of Stirling-type asymptotic formulas, and then bounding these integrals by asymptotically optimal bounds. Additionally, all the proofs given rely only on common elementary arguments and connect, generalise and possibly improve various results that have been published previously. Lastly, we provide numerical comparisons concerning the effectiveness and behaviour of the bounds and approximations in a graphical manner, which clearly indicate that the bounds are asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>On Approximate Computation of Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.</description>

      <title>Extremal conditional independence for H\"usler-Reiss distributions via modular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extremal conditional independence for H\"{u}sler-Reiss distributions, which is a parametric subclass of multivariate Pareto distributions. As the main contribution, we introduce two set functions, i.e.~functions which assign a value to the distribution and each of its marginals, and show that extremal conditional independence statements can be characterized by modularity relations for these functions. For the first function, we make use of the close connection between H\"{u}sler-Reiss and Gaussian models to introduce a multiinformation-inspired measure $m^{\text{HR}}$ for H\"{u}sler-Reiss distributions. For the second function, we consider an invariant $\sigma^2$ that is naturally associated to the H\"{u}sler-Reiss parameterization and establish the second modularity criterion under additional positivity constraints. Together, these results provide new tools for describing extremal dependence structures in high-dimensional extreme value statistics. In addition, we study the geometry of a bounded subset of H\"usler-Reiss parameters and its relation with the Gaussian elliptope.</description>

      <title>Motivic pieces of curves: $L$-functions and periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a curve $C$ over a number field $K$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$ by $K$-automorphisms, one obtains a factorisation of $L(C,s)$ into a product of $L$-functions of `motivic pieces of curves' associated to irreducible $G$-representations. We describe an algorithm for explicitly computing values of these $L$-functions, demonstrating implementations in the cases of certain curves with actions by $C_3$, $C_4$ and $D_{10}$. We explain how this algorithm can be used to factor $L$-functions of curves with endomorphisms of Hecke type.
  Towards applications, we explicitly formulate and numerically verify a version of Deligne's Period Conjecture for hitherto-uninvestigated $L$-functions arising from motivic pieces of superelliptic curves.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops precise asymptotic formulas for expanding non-spherical averages on compact quotients of real rank-one Lie groups, focusing on $SO(n,1)$ as a model case. Using tools from harmonic analysis and representation theory, the study reduces the analysis of orbit averages to an ordinary (ODE) derived from the action of the Casimir operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Kauffman-Murasugi-Thistlethwaite-type theorem for alternating knots in a solid torus. Specifically, we show that any dotted-reduced alternating diagram of a knot in a handlebody realizes the minimal crossing number, and that any two such diagrams of the same knot have identical writhe. The proof relies on a generalization of the Jones polynomial to the setting of handlebodies. A stronger version of this result was already proved by Boden, Karimi, and Sikora using a different generalized Jones polynomial; therefore, this text largely expands on one of the main proof tools.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of tropical Tevelev degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tropical Tevelev degrees arising from maps between certain tropical moduli spaces of curves. Building on work of Dawson and Cavalieri, who defined and computed tropical Tevelev degrees in the case of degree $d = g+1$ and $n = g+3$ marked points, we extend the theory by introducing an additional integer parameter $\ell$. In our framework the curve degree and number of marked points vary as $d = g + 1 + \ell$ and $n = g + 3 + 2\ell$, and we analyze the resulting tropical Tevelev degrees for both positive and negative values of $\ell$. This tropicalizes results of Cela, Pandharipande, and Schmitt on algebraic Tevelev degrees. We then further broaden the framework by introducing generalized tropical Tevelev degrees, providing the tropical counterpart to the generalized Tevelev degrees studied by Cela and Lian. These results establish a wider set of computational and structural patterns for intersection calculations on tropical moduli spaces and reveal new behavior beyond the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Metric Approximations of Consistent Path Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A path system $\mathscr{P}$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $V$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is closed under subpaths. We say that a path system $\mathscr{P}$ is $\alpha$-metric if there exists a metric $\rho$ on $V$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{k}\rho(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \le \alpha \rho(x_0,x_k)$ for every path $(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_k)\in \mathscr{P}$. Also, we denote by $\Delta(\mathscr{P})$ the infimum of $\alpha$ for which $\mathscr{P}$ is $\alpha$-metric. We construct here infinitely many $n$-point consistent path systems $\mathscr{P}_n$ with $\Delta(\mathscr{P}_n) \ge n^{\frac{1}{2}-o(1)}$. We also show how to efficiently compute $\Delta(\mathscr{P})$ for a given path system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a batched first-order method for solving multiple linear programs in parallel on GPUs. Our approach extends the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm to efficiently solve batches of related linear programming problems that arise in mixed-integer programming techniques such as strong branching and bound tightening. By leveraging matrix-matrix operations instead of repeated matrix-vector operations, we obtain significant computational advantages on GPU architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various case studies and identify the problem sizes where first-order methods outperform traditional simplex-based solvers depending on the computational environment one can use. This is a significant step for the design and development of integer programming algorithms tightly exploiting GPU capabilities where we argue that some specific operations should be allocated to GPUs and performed in full instead of using light-weight heuristic approaches on CPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present criteria in terms of dual pairs of exceptional sequences for an abelian category to be highest weight. The criteria are applied in three situations of geometric origin. We give new proofs for the facts that the category of perverse sheaves of middle perversity on complex-analytic manifolds with suitable conditions on the stratification is highest weight and that the derived coherent category of any Grassmannian has a $t$-structure with highest weight heart. Also we show that the abelian null category of any proper birational morphism of regular surfaces is highest weight. For this null category, we give a geometric description of some special objects related to the highest weight structure, such as standard, costandard and characteristic tilting objects.</description>

      <title>Fully exact and fully dualizable module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define fully exact module categories, a subclass of exact module categories over a finite braided tensor category that is stable under the relative Deligne product. In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones.
  The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable.
  In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect.
  As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.</description>

      <title>A categorical equivalence for monadic algebras of first-order substructural logics motivated by Kalman's construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category $\mathbb{DRDL'}$, whose objects are c-differential residuated distributive lattices that satisfy the condition $\mathbf{CK}$, is the image of the category $\mathbb{RDL}$, whose objects are residuated distributive lattices, under the categorical equivalence (Kalman functor) $\mathbf{K}$. The main goal of this paper is to lift this equivalence $\mathbf{K}$ to the category $\mathbb{MRDL}$, whose objects are monadic residuated distributive lattices, and the category $\mathbb{MDRDL'}$, whose objects are pairs formed by an object of $\mathbb{DRDL'}$ and a center universal quantifier. Firstly, based on the variety of monadic FL$_\textrm{e}$-algebras, we introduce the concept of monadic residuated lattices and study some of their further algebraic properties, proving the classes of monadic residuated distributive lattices and monadic c-differential residuated distributive lattices are in one-to-one correspondence. Subsequently, based on this corresponding relation, we prove that there exists a categorical equivalence between the categories $\mathbb{MRDL}$ and $\mathbb{MDRDL'}$. The results of this paper not only generalizes the works of Sagastume and San Mart\'{i}n in [Mathematical Logic Quarterly, {\bf 60}(2014), 375--388], but also addresses and overcomes the limitations identified in the works of [Studia Logica, {\bf 111}(2023), 361--390]. Finally, this paper concludes with some applications regarding descriptions of a 2-contextual translation.</description>

      <title>Anderson Mixing in Bures Wasserstein Space of Gaussian Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various statistical tasks, including sampling or computing Wasserstein barycenters, can be reformulated as fixed-point problems for operators on probability distributions.
  Accelerating standard fixed-point iteration schemes provides a promising novel approach to the design of efficient numerical methods for these problems.
  The Wasserstein geometry on the space of probability measures, although not precisely Riemannian, allows us to define various useful Riemannian notions, such as tangent spaces, exponential maps and parallel transport, motivating the adaptation of Riemannian numerical methods.
  We demonstrate this by developing and implementing the Riemannian Anderson Mixing (RAM) method for Gaussian distributions.
  The method reuses the history of the residuals and improves the iteration complexity, and we argue that the additional costs, compared to Picard method, are negligible.
  We show that certain open balls in the Bures-Wasserstein manifold satisfy the requirements for convergence of RAM.
  The numerical experiments show a significant acceleration compared to a Picard iteration, and performance on par with Riemannian Gradient Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods.</description>

Abstract: We study the homogeneous involutions on the full square matrices over an algebraically closed field endowed with a division grading with commutative support. We obtain the classification of the isomorphism and equivalence classes for the Pauli grading. We also investigate the homogeneous involutions on the full square matrices with entries in a finite-dimensional graded-division algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not $2$ endowed with an arbitrary grading by an arbitrary group.</description>

Abstract: We study the ergodic behaviour of the McKean-Vlasov equations driven by common, divergence-free transport noise. In particular, we show that in dimension $d\geq 2$, if the noise is mixing and sufficiently strong it can enforce the uniqueness of invariant probability measures, even if the deterministic part of equation has multiple steady states.</description>

      <title>Canonical chain complexes for Morse-Smale vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, Smale defined a filtration of a closed smooth manifold by the unstable manifolds of fixed points and closed orbits of a Morse-Smale vector field defined on it, and derived generalized Morse inequalities. This suggests that, similarly to the Morse chain complex of a gradient-like vector field, even in the presence of closed orbits, Morse-Smale vector fields admit canonical chain complexes, invariant under topological equivalence, from which one can algebraically derive Morse inequalities. In this paper we show that this is actually the case, improving the state of the art that only offers non-canonical chain complexes. Technically, we achieve this result considering the \v{C}ech homology spectral sequence of the unstable manifolds filtration. In particular, we turn bounded exact couples into chain complexes such that the limit page of the spectral sequence associated with an exact couple gives the homology of the chain complex. We showcase our construction with examples.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Coxeter polytopes that have finite volume in their Vinberg domains are exactly the quasiperfect Coxeter polytopes of negative type, i.e. the Coxeter polytopes that are contained in their properly convex Vinberg domain, at the exception of some vertices that are C^1 points of the boundary. As a corollary, we show that for reflection groups \`a la Vinberg, the Vinberg domain is the only invariant properly convex domain if and only if the action is of finite covolume on the Vinberg domain and the dimension is at least 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed subscheme $Z$ in a smooth variety $X$, defined by the maximal minors of an $s\times r$ matrix of regular functions, with $s\geq r$, we consider the corresponding incidence correspondence $W$ in $Y=X\times {\mathbf P}^{r-1}$, and relate the log canonical thresholds of $(X,Z)$ and $(Y,W)$. In particular, when $r=s$, we show that ${\rm lct}(X,Z)=1$ if and only if ${\rm lct}(Y,W)=r$. Moreover, in this case, we show that $Z$ has rational singularities if and only if $W$ has pure codimension $r$ in $Y$ and has rational singularities. As a consequence, we deduce that for a configuration hypersurface with a connected configuration matroid, the corresponding configuration incidence variety has rational singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of probabilistically strong, measure-valued solutions for the stochastic incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and prove their convergence, in the vanishing viscosity limit, to probabilistically strong solutions for the stochastic incompressible Euler equations. In particular, this solves the open problem of constructing probabilistically strong solutions for the stochastic Euler equations that satisfy the energy inequality for general $L^2$ initial data. We introduce the concept of energy-variational solutions in the stochastic context in order to treat the nonlinearities without changing the probability space. Furthermore, we extend these results to fluids driven by transport noise.</description>

      <title>Volt/VAR Optimization in Transmission Networks with Discrete-Control Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage (Volt) and reactive-power (VAR) control in transmission networks is critical for reliability and increasingly needs fast, implementable decisions. This paper presents a transmission Volt/VAR Optimization (VVO) framework that co-optimizes discrete control of on-load tap-changing transformers (OLTCs) and capacitor banks (CBs) with AC power flow (ACPF) physics to improve voltage stability and minimize VAR generation. The framework follows a relax-round-resolve pipeline: a continuous relaxation proposes targets, a rounding step selects feasible discrete settings, and a final solve enforces AC power flow physics. Extensive experiments on IEEE, PEGASE, and RTE systems show consistent improvements in voltage and VAR quality metrics with modest generator redispatch while preserving economic operation and achieving compatible runtimes with real-time transmission operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS), which was recently derived in \cite{M24} as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional configuration space. While the geometric framework and the global weak flow were outlined there, the present paper provides the analytical foundations of this construction from the PDE perspective.
  First, we derive an explicit solution formula in Lagrangian variables via a Riccati reduction, yielding an alternative proof of the blow-up criterion together with an explicit expression for the blow-up time. Second, we rigorously construct global conservative weak solutions by developing the analytic theory of the relaxed configuration space and the associated weak magnetic geodesic flow, thereby realizing the geometric program proposed in \cite{M24}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between bijective, not necessarily finite, set-theoretic solutions of the pentagon equation and Hopf algebras. Firstly, we prove that finite solutions correspond to Hopf algebras with the positive basis property. As a corollary we generalise Lu-Yan-Zhu classification to arbitrary characteristic $0$ fields $k$. Secondly, we study the general problem of when a Hopf algebra has a basis yielding a set-theoretic solution. Finally, we classify all (co)commutative bijective solutions. This result requires to obtain a description of all bases of a group algebra $k[G]$ yielding a set-theoretic solution. We namely show that such bases correspond, through a Fourier transform, to splittings $A \rtimes N$ of $G$ with $A$ a finite abelian group.</description>

      <title>Half-space type theorems for a class of weighted minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish half-space type results for a class of height-dependent weighted minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$, namely critical points of a weighted area functional whose weight depends on the height. When the weight has at most quadratic growth, we prove that there are no proper surfaces contained either in two transverse vertical half-spaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$ or in a half-space determined by a non-vertical plane. We show that this second result holds in a more general context, namely, for a class of stochastically complete weighted minimal surfaces. In this setup, we also prove a result for surfaces contained in regions bounded by cones. Furthermore, for stochastically complete weighted minimal surfaces satisfying restrictions on their principal curvatures, we establish a version of the classic strong half-space result due to Hoffman-Meeks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Martingale Estimators: Structured Estimators for Maximizing Information Freshness in Query-Based Update Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates information freshness in a remote estimation system in which the remote information source is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the empirical measure of moderately interacting particle systems subject to singular forces derived by Lennard-Jones potential. Although the classical Lennard-Jones force is widely used in molecular dynamics, analytical results are not available. We consider a Lennard-Jones potential with free parameters in the McKean-Vlasov framework and proceed with a regularization at the mesoscale letting the particles interact moderately. We prove the well-posedness of the McKean-Vlasov SDE involving such singular kernels and the convergence of the empirical measure towards the solution of the McKean-Vlasov Fokker-Planck PDE, by means of a semigroup approach. We derive both the range of parameters characterizing the aggregation and repulsive force and the mesoscale order for which the convergence is achieved, by obtaining the right integrability regularity of the drift.</description>

As a byproduct, we have the algebraic classification of $3$-dimensional metabelian commutative algebras and $3$-dimensional derived commutative associative algebras. After that, we introduced a method of classifying $n$-dimensional bicommutative algebras, based on the classification of $n$-dimensional derived commutative associative algebras, and applied it to the classification of $3$-dimensional bicommutative algebras. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the geometric classification of $3$-dimensional metabelian commutative, derived commutative associative, derived Jordan and bicommutative algebras.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic cycle partitions of $r$-edge-coloured graphs with high minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question posed independently by Letzter and Pokrovskiy asks: how many vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles are needed to cover the vertex set of an $r$-edge-coloured graph, as a function of its minimum (uncoloured) degree? We resolve this problem up to a $(\log r)$-factor. Specifically, we prove that, for any $r \geq 2$ and $\delta \in (0,1/2)$, any $n$-vertex $r$-edge-coloured graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \geq (1- \delta)n$ can be covered with $\mathcal{O}(r \log r \cdot \lceil r/\log(1/\delta)\rceil)$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles. We construct graphs that show this is tight up to the $(\log r)$-factor for all values of $r$ and $\delta$, and along the way disprove a conjecture of Bal and DeBiasio about monochromatic tree covering.</description>

      <title>Microlocal maximal hypoellipticity from the geometric viewpoint: I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given some vector fields on a smooth manifold satisfying H\"ormander's condition, we define a bi-graded pseudo-differential calculus which contains the classical pseudo-differential calculus and a pseudo-differential calculus adapted to the sub-Riemannian structure induced by the vector fields.
  Our approach is based on geometric constructions (resolution of singularities) together with methods from operators algebras. We develop this calculus in full generality, including Sobolev spaces, the wavefront set, and the principal symbol, etc.
  In particular, using this calculus, we prove that invertibility of the principal symbol implies microlocal maximal hypoellipticity. This allows us to resolve affirmatively the microlocal version of a conjecture of Helffer and Nourrigat.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Higher-Order Riemannian Optimization: Optimal and Implementable Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first optimal-rate $p$-th order methods with $p\geq 1$ for finding first and second-order stationary points of non-convex smooth objective functions over Riemannian manifolds. In contrast to the geodesically convex setting, we definitively establish that the optimal oracle complexity of non-convex optimization over manifolds matches that over Euclidean space. In parallel with the complexity analysis, we introduce a general framework for systematically studying higher-order regularity on Riemannian manifolds that characterizes its joint dependence on the objective function and the chosen retraction. To the best of our knowledge, this framework constitutes the first known application in optimization of pullback connections and the Sasaki metric to the study of retraction-based pullbacks of the objective function. We provide clean derivative bounds based on a new covariant Fa\`a di Bruno formula derived within our framework. For $p=3$, our methods are fully implementable via a new Krylov-based framework for minimizing quartically regularized cubic polynomials. This is the first Krylov method for this class of polynomials and may be of independent interest beyond Riemannian optimization.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and anomalous regularization in self-similar random incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a particle in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, subject to molecular diffusion and advection by a random incompressible flow. The velocity field is the divergence of a stationary random stream matrix $\mathbf{k} $ with positive Hurst exponent $\gamma &gt; 0$, so the resulting random environment is multiscale and self-similar. In the perturbative regime $\gamma \ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-\gamma)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\nabla \cdot (\nu I_d + \mathbf{k} ) \nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^\gamma$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are H\"older continuous with exponent $1 - C\gamma^{\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $\nu$ and the scale.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of regular $q$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite vector space $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$, the $q$-analogue of a graph, called a $q$-graph, is a pair $\Gamma=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of $1$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ and $\mathcal{E}$ is a subset of the $2$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Elements of $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are called vertices and edges, respectively. If the edges through a vertex $X$ consist of all $2$-spaces of a $(k+1)$-dimensional space which contain $X$, regardless of the choice of vertex, then $\Gamma$ is $k$-regular. Moreover, $\Gamma$ is flag-transitive if there is a subgroup of $\Gamma {\rm L}_n(q)$ preserving $\mathcal{E}$ and acting transitively on the set of all incident vertex-edge pairs; and symmetric if there is a subgroup of $\Gamma {\rm L}_n(q)$ preserving $\mathcal{E}$ and acting transitively on the set of all ordered pairs of adjacent vertices.
  This paper classifies all $k$-regular $q$-graphs that are either flag-transitive or symmetric. The $q$-graphs in the classification are constructed from familiar objects in finite geometry, including spreads, symplectic polar spaces, and generalised hexagons. The classification depends essentially on the classification of transitive linear groups, and thus ultimately on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Cobordism and Concordance of Surfaces in 4-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two properly embedded compact surfaces in an orientable 4-manifold are cobordant if and only if they are $\mathbb{Z}/2$-homologous and either the 4-manifold has boundary or the surfaces have the same normal Euler number. If the 4-manifold is simply-connected and the surfaces are closed, non-orientable, and cobordant, we show that they are in fact concordant. This completes the classification of closed surfaces in simply-connected 4-manifolds up to concordance. Our methods give new constructions of cobordisms with prescribed boundaries, and completely determine when a given cobordism between the boundaries extends to a cobordism or concordance between the surfaces. We obtain our concordance results by extending Sunukjian's method of ambient surgery to the unoriented case using Pin$^-$-structures. We also discuss conditions for an arbitrary codimension 2 properly embedded submanifold to admit an unoriented spanning manifold with prescribed boundary. All results hold in both the smooth and topological categories.</description>

      <title>Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Samplers: Typical and Worst Case Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the utility and limitations of using $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H = ([n], E)$ ($n \ge \mathrm{poly}(k)$) in the context of error reduction for randomized algorithms for decision problems with one- or two-sided error. Our error reduction idea is sampling a uniformly random hyperedge of $H$, and repeating the algorithm $k$ times using the hyperedge vertices as seeds. This is a general paradigm, which captures every pseudorandom method generating $k$ seeds without repetition. We show two results which imply a gap between the typical and the worst-case behavior of using $H$ for error-reduction.
  First, in the context of one-sided error reduction, if using a random hyperedge of $H$ decreases the error probability from $p$ to $p^k + \epsilon$, then $H$ cannot have too few edges, i.e., $|E| = \Omega(n k^{-1} \epsilon^{-1})$. Thus, the number of random bits needed for reducing the error from $p$ to $p^k + \epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\lg n+\lg(\epsilon^{-1})-\lg k+O(1)$. This is also true for hypergraphs of average uniformity $k$. Our result implies new lower bounds for dispersers and vertex-expanders.
  Second, if the vertex degrees are reasonably distributed, we show that in a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of the cases, choosing $k$ pseudorandom seeds using $H$ will reduce the error probability to at most $o(1)$ above the error probability of using $k$ IID seeds, for both algorithms with one- or two-sided error. Thus, despite our lower bound, for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of randomized algorithms (and inputs) for decision problems, the advantage of using IID samples over samples obtained from a uniformly random edge of a reasonable hypergraph is negligible. A similar statement holds true for randomized algorithms with two-sided error.</description>

      <title>Single-Nodal Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in NLP Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.</description>

      <title>Latent-IMH: Efficient Bayesian Inference for Inverse Problems with Approximate Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian linear inverse problems where $A$, the parameters to observables operator, is computationally expensive. In many applications, $A$ can be factored in a manner that facilitates the construction of a cost-effective approximation $\tilde{A}$. In this framework, we introduce Latent-IMH, a sampling method based on the Metropolis-Hastings independence (IMH) sampler. Latent-IMH first generates intermediate latent variables using the approximate $\tilde{A}$, and then refines them using the exact $A$. Its primary benefit is that it shifts the computational cost to an offline phase. We theoretically analyze the performance of Latent-IMH using KL divergence and mixing time bounds. Using numerical experiments on several model problems, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency. In some cases, Latent-IMH can be orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of large population symmetric games, approximate Nash equilibria are introduced through equilibrium solutions of the corresponding mean field game in the sense that the individual gain from optimal unilateral deviation under such strategies converges to zero in the large population size asymptotic. We show that these strategies satisfy an $\L^\infty$ notion of approximate Nash equilibrium which guarantees that the individual gain from optimal unilateral deviation is small uniformly among players and uniformly on their initial characteristics. We establish these results in the context of static models and in the dynamic continuous time setting, and we cover situations where the agents' criteria depend on the conditional law of the controlled state process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pairs of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that share the same vacuum moduli space and the same chiral field content, encoded by a common quiver, but differ in their superpotentials. These theories arise as worldvolume theories on a D3-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold and admit a description in terms of bipartite graphs on a 2-torus, known as brane tilings. Using an explicit example, we show that the correspondence is realized by a single `tilting' mutation along the diagonals of hexagonal faces in the brane tiling, which is equivalent to a specific sequence of Seiberg dualities performed at distinct gauge nodes in the quiver.</description>

      <title>The Tensionless Lives of Null Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensionless limit probes the very high energy regime of string theory in contrast to the well studied point-particle limit which reduces to Einstein gravity. Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade.
  Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins.
  The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them. We also discuss Carroll strings, applications of these ideas to strings approaching black holes and give a quick overview of other related developments.</description>

      <title>On the Integrable Structure of the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Universal Agnostic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.</description>

      <title>Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.</description>

      <title>Solver-in-the-Loop: MDP-Based Benchmarks for Self-Correction and Behavioral Rationality in Operations Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.</description>

      <title>Sparse Grassmannian Design for Noncoherent Codes via Schubert Cell Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for designing sparse Grassmannian codes for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output systems. Conventional pairwise error probability formulations under uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels fail to account for rank deficiency induced by sparse configurations. We revise these formulations to handle such cases in a unified manner. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form metric that effectively maximizes the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI) at a given signal-to-noise ratio. We focus on the fact that the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmann manifold provides a mathematically sparse property, and establish design criteria for sparse noncoherent codes based on our analyses. In numerical results, the proposed sparse noncoherent codes outperform conventional methods in terms of both symbol error rate and AMI, and asymptotically approach the performance of the optimal Grassmannian constellations in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime. Moreover, they reduce the time and space complexity, which does not scale with the number of transmit antennas.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional learning dynamics of multi-pass Stochastic Gradient Descent in multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $\kappa \asymp n^\alpha$ where $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: We establish efficient algorithms for weakly-interacting quantum spin systems at arbitrary temperature. In particular, we obtain a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function and an efficient approximate sampling scheme for the thermal distribution over a classical spin space. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method and a standard reduction from approximate sampling to approximate counting.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solve this problem uses the classical random walks on the graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our procedure of community detection on a number of graphs and social networks, such as the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, dolphin's social network, etc.</description>

      <title>A Sheaf-Theoretic and Topological Perspective on Complex Network Modeling and Attention Mechanisms in Graph Neural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman Iterative Learning and Stability-Guaranteed Control for Unknown Nonlinear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Koopman-based framework for modeling, prediction, and control of unknown nonlinear time-varying systems. We present a novel Koopman-based learning method for predicting the state of unknown nonlinear time-varying systems, upon which a robust controller is designed to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is input-to-state stable with respect to the Koopman approximation error. The error of the lifted system model learned through the Koopman-based method increases over time due to the time-varying nature of the nonlinear time-varying system. To address this issue, an online iterative update scheme is incorporated into the learning process to update the lifted system model, aligning it more precisely with the time-varying nonlinear system by integrating the updated data and discarding the outdated data. A necessary condition for the feasibility of the proposed iterative learning method is derived. In order to reduce unnecessary system updates while ensuring the prediction accuracy of the lifted system, the update mechanism is enhanced to determine whether to update the lifted system and meanwhile to reduce updates that deteriorate the fitting performance. Furthermore, based on the online-updated lifted system, a controller is designed to ensure the closed-loop controlled system be input-to-state stable with respect to the Koopman approximation error. Numerical simulations on the Duffing oscillator, the serial manipulator, and the synthetic biological network system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the approximation and control of unknown nonlinear time-varying systems. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of approximation accuracy and computational efficiency, even under significant system variations.</description>

      <title>PILD: Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools for modeling complex data distributions, yet their purely data-driven nature limits applicability in practical engineering and scientific problems where physical laws need to be followed. This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines.</description>

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/\nu = 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.</description>

      <title>Lossy Common Information in a Learnable Gray-Wyner Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.</description>

      <title>A block-coordinate descent framework for non-convex composite optimization. Application to sparse precision matrix estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.</description>

      <title>PPI-SVRG: Unifying Prediction-Powered Inference and Variance Reduction for Semi-Supervised Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.</description>

      <title>Best Arm Identification with LLM Judges and Limited Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Control on Sparse Graphs: From Local Limits to GNNs via Neighborhood Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field control (MFC) offers a scalable solution to the curse of dimensionality in multi-agent systems but traditionally hinges on the restrictive assumption of exchangeability via dense, all-to-all interactions. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.</description>

      <title>Strassen's support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strassen's asymptotic spectrum offers a framework for analyzing the complexity of tensors. It has found applications in diverse areas, from computer science to additive combinatorics and quantum information. A long-standing open problem, dating back to 1991, asks whether Strassen's support functionals are universal spectral points, that is, points in the asymptotic spectrum of tensors.
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by proving that the support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals - universal spectral points that are defined via entropy optimization on entanglement polytopes. We obtain this result as a special case of a general minimax formula for convex optimization on entanglement polytopes (and other moment polytopes) that has further applications to other tensor parameters, including the asymptotic slice rank. Our proof is based on a recent Fenchel-type duality theorem on Hadamard manifolds due to Hirai.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Equivariant Networks are Layerwise Equivariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.</description>

      <title>Scattering laws for interfaces in self-gravitating matter flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of self-gravitating matter fields that may undergo phase transitions, and we connect ideas from phase transition dynamics with concepts from bouncing cosmology. Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of covert communication over the entanglement-assisted (EA) bosonic multiple access channel (MAC). We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of \(O(\sqrt{n} \log n)\) covert bits with the block length $n$ for both senders, surpassing the square-root law as in the point-to-point case. Our analysis reveals that the joint covertness constraint imposes a linear trade-off between the senders throughput.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Rapid estimation of global sea surface temperatures from sparse streaming in situ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) from staggered SST measurements is essential for weather forecasting and climate projections. However, when SST measurements are sparse, the resulting inferred SST fields are rather inaccurate. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) to reconstruct the high-resolution SST field from sparse in situ observations, without using a model. The S-DEIM estimate consists of two terms, one computed from instantaneous in situ observations using empirical interpolation, and the other learned from the historical time series of observations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We train the RNNs using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weekly high-resolution SST dataset spanning the years 1989-2021 which constitutes the training data. Subsequently, we examine the performance of S-DEIM on the test data, comprising January 2022 to January 2023. For this test data, S-DEIM infers the high-resolution SST from 100 in situ observations, constituting only 0.2% of the high-resolution spatial grid. We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\pm 1^\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Dimension-Free Convergence and Loss-Adaptive Schedules for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of discriminative power and complexity in learning quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $\Theta(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $\Theta(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $\Theta(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Distribution-free Adaptive Computation of Matrix Functions for Accelerating Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix functions such as square root, inverse roots, and orthogonalization play a central role in preconditioned gradient methods for neural network training. This has motivated the development of iterative algorithms that avoid explicit eigendecompositions and rely primarily on matrix multiplications, making them well suited for modern GPU accelerators. We present PRISM (Polynomial-fitting and Randomized Iterative Sketching for Matrix functions computation), a general framework for accelerating iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. PRISM combines adaptive polynomial approximation with randomized sketching: at each iteration, it fits a polynomial surrogate to the current spectrum via a sketched least-squares problem, adapting to the instance at hand with minimal overhead. We apply PRISM to accelerate Newton-Schulz-like iterations for matrix square roots and orthogonalization, which are core primitives in machine learning. Unlike prior methods, PRISM requires no explicit spectral bounds or singular value estimates; and it adapts automatically to the evolving spectrum. Empirically, PRISM accelerates training when integrated into Shampoo and Muon optimizers.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations in hydrodynamics and quantum long-time tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.</description>

      <title>Global existence, blowup phenomena, and asymptotic behavior for quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.05136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} iu_t=\Delta u+2uh'(|u|^2)\Delta h(|u|^2)+F(|u|^2)u \quad {\rm for} \ x\in \mathbb{R}^N, \ t&gt;0\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^N. \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} Here $h(s)$ and $F(s)$ are some real-valued functions, with various choices for models from mathematical physics. We examine the interplay between the quasilinear effect of $h$ and nonlinear effect of $F$ for the global existence and blowup phenomena. We provide sufficient conditions on the blowup in finite time and global existence of the solution. In some cases, we can deduce the watershed from these conditions. In the focusing case, we construct the sharp threshold for the blowup in finite time and global existence of the solution and lower bound for blowup rate of the blowup solution.</description>

      <title>Counting embedded curves in symplectic 6-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on computations of Pandharipande, Zinger proved that the Gopakumar-Vafa BPS invariants $\mathrm{BPS}_{A,g}(X,\omega)$ for primitive Calabi-Yau classes and arbitrary Fano classes $A$ on a symplectic $6$-manifold $(X,\omega)$ agree with the signed count $n_{A,g}(X,\omega)$ of embedded $J$-holomorphic curves representing $A$ and of genus $g$ for a generic almost complex structure $J$ compatible with $\omega$. Zinger's proof of the invariance of $n_{A,g}(X,\omega)$ is indirect, as it relies on Gromov-Witten theory. In this article we give a direct proof of the invariance of $n_{A,g}(X,\omega)$. Furthermore, we prove that $n_{A,g}(X,\omega) = 0$ for $g \gg 1$, thus proving the Gopakumar-Vafa finiteness conjecture for primitive Calabi-Yau classes and arbitrary Fano classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the advective unstable Cahn-Hilliard equation in 2D with shear flow: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} u_t+Av_1(y) \partial_x u+\varepsilon \Delta^2 u= \Delta(a u^3+ b u^2) \quad &amp; \quad \textrm{on} \quad \mathbb T^2; \\ \\ u \ \textrm{periodic} \quad &amp; \quad \textrm{on} \quad \partial \mathbb T^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} with an initial data $u_0 \in H_0^2(\mathbb T^2)$, where $\mathbb T^2$ is the two-dimensional torus, $A, \varepsilon&gt;0$, $a&lt;0$, $b \in \mathbb R$. Under the assumption that the shear has a finite number of critical points and there are linearly growing modes only in the direction of the shear, we show the $L^2$-energy of the solutions to such problems converges expotentially to zero, if in addition, both $|a|$ and $\left\| \int_{\mathbb T} u_0(x, \cdot ) dx \right\|_{L_y^2}$ are sufficiently small.</description>

Abstract: We consider the class of conservative-dissipative ODE systems, which is a subclass of Lyapunov stable, linear time-invariant ODE systems. We characterize asymptotically stable, conservative-dissipative ODE systems via the hypocoercivity (theory) of their system matrices. Our main result is a concise characterization of the hypocoercivity index (an algebraic structural property of matrices with positive semi-definite Hermitian part introduced in Achleitner, Arnold, and Carlen (2018)) in terms of the short time behavior of the propagator norm for the associated conservative-dissipative ODE system.</description>

Abstract: For $\textrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ ($n\geq3$), $\textrm{SO}(n+1,n)$ ($n\geq2$), $\textrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ ($n\geq2$) and for the adjoint real split form of the exceptional group $\textrm{G}_2$, we exhibit non-uniform lattices in which we construct thin Hitchin representations by arithmetic methods. These representations give infinitely many orbits under the action of the mapping class group (except maybe for $\textrm{G}_2$). In particular, we show that when $p\neq2$ is prime every non-uniform lattice of $\mathrm{SL}(p,\mathbb{R})$ contains thin Hitchin representations.</description>

      <title>Constructing linear bicategories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearly distributive categories were introduced to model the tensor/par fragment of linear logic, without resorting to the use of negation. Linear bicategories are the bicategorical version of linearly distributive categories. Essentially, a linear bicategory has two forms of composition, each determining the structure of a bicategory, and the two compositions are related by a linear distribution. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that there are many examples of linear bicategories, which are obtained by considering quantales and quantaloids. It is standard in the field of monoidal topology that the category of quantale-valued relations is a bicategory. Here we begin by showing that a quantale is Girard if and only if the corresponding bicategory is a Girard quantaloid, which is an example of linear bicategory. The tropical and arctic semiring structures fit together into a Girard quantale, so this construction is likely to have multiple applications. More generally, we define LD-quantales, which are sup-lattices with two quantale structures related by a linear distribution, and their bicategorical analogue, linear quantaloids. We show that Q-Rel is a linear quantaloid if and only if Q is an LD-quantale. We then consider several standard constructions from enriched bicategory theory, and show that these lift to the linear quantaloid setting and produce new examples of linear bicategories. In particular, we consider linear Q-categories, matrices in Q and linear monads in Q, where Q is a linear quantaloid. We develop non-locally posetal examples as well, Quant, the bicategory of quantales, modules and module homomorphisms, and Qtld, the bicategory of quantaloids, modules and module homomorphisms. These turn out to be cyclic *-autonomous bicategories, which are in essence a closed version of linear bicategories.</description>

Abstract: We analyse a certain family of cellular integrals, which are period integrals on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,8}$ of curves of genus zero with eight marked points, and give rise to simultaneous rational approximations to $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(5)$. By exploiting the action of a large symmetry group on these integrals, we construct an infinite $effective$ sequence of rational approximations $p/q$ to $\zeta(5)$ satisfying \[ 0&lt;\bigg|\zeta(5)-\frac pq\bigg|&lt;\frac1{q^{0.86}}. \]</description>

For $\mathbb{G}_m$ or an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K$, we establish uniformity results on the number of $S$-integral torsion points relative to a non-torsion point $\beta$, as $\beta$ varies over number fields of bounded degree. In particular for $\mathbb{G}_m$, if $D$ is a positive integer, we prove a uniform bound on the degree of a torsion point $\zeta$ that is $S$-integral relative to a non-torsion point $\beta$ with degree $\leq D$.</description>

      <title>Online Detection of Changes in Moment-Based Projections: When to Retrain Deep Learners or Update Portfolios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training deep learning neural networks often requires massive amounts of computational ressources. We propose to sequentially monitor network predictions to trigger retraining only if the predictions are no longer valid. This can reduce drastically computational costs and opens a door to green deep learning. Our approach is based on the relationship to projected second moments monitoring, a problem also arising in other areas such as computational finance. Various open--end as well as closed--end monitoring rules are studied under mild assumptions on the training sample and the observations of the monitoring period. The results allow for high--dimensional non-stationary time series data and thus, especially, non--i.i.d. training data. Asymptotics is based on Gaussian approximations of projected partial sums allowing for an estimated projection vector. Estimation of projection vectors is studied both for classical non--$\ell_0$--sparsity as well as under sparsity. For the case that the optimal projection depends on the unknown covariance matrix, hard-- and soft--thresholded estimators are studied. The method is analyzed by simulations and supported by synthetic data experiments.</description>

      <title>Global weak solution of 3-D focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the existence of global weak solutions to the three-dimensional focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the non-radial case. Furthermore, we prove the weak-strong uniqueness for some class of initial data. The main ingredient of our new approach is to use solutions of an energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation as approximations for the corresponding nonlinear Sch\"ordinger equation.
  In our proofs, we first show the dichotomy of global well-posedness versus finite time blow-up of energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation in $\dot{H}^1( \mathbb{R}^d)$ for $d = 3,4 $ when the energy is less than the energy of the stationary solution $W$. We follow the strategy of C. E. Kenig and F. Merle [25,26], using a concentration-compactness/rigidity argument to reduce the global well-posedness to the exclusion of a critical element. The critical element is ruled out by dissipation of the Ginzburg-Landau equation, including local smoothness, backwards uniqueness and unique continuation. The existence of global weak solution of the three dimensional focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the non-radial case then follows from the global well-posedness of the energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation via a limitation argument. We also adapt the arguments of M. Struwe [37,38] to prove the weak-strong uniqueness when the $\dot{H}^1$-norm of the initial data is bounded by a constant depending on the stationary solution $W$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any multiplicative quiver variety is endowed with a Poisson structure constructed by Van den Bergh through reduction from a Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson structure. The smooth locus carries a corresponding symplectic form defined by Yamakawa through quasi-Hamiltonian reduction. In this note, we include the Poisson structure as part of a pencil of compatible Poisson structures on the multiplicative quiver variety. The pencil is defined by reduction from a pencil of Hamiltonian quasi-Poisson structures which has dimension $\ell(\ell-1)/2$, where $\ell$ is the number of arrows in the underlying quiver. For each element of the pencil, we exhibit the corresponding compatible symplectic or quasi-Hamiltonian structure. We comment on analogous constructions for character varieties and quiver varieties. This formalism is applied to the spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider phase space in order to explain the compatibility of two Poisson structures that have recently appeared in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $S$ a finite set of places of $K$ that contains all of the archimedean places. Let $\varphi: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ defined over $K$. Given $\alpha \in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ non-preperiodic and $\beta \in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ non-exceptional, we prove an upper bound of the form $O(|S|^{1+\epsilon})$ on the number of points in the forward orbit of $\alpha$ that are $S$-integral relative to $\beta$, extending results of Hsia--Silverman [HS11]. We also prove uniform bounds when $\varphi$ is a polynomial, extending resaults of Krieger et al [KLS+15].</description>

      <title>Critical line of exponents, scattering theories for a weighted gradient system of semilinear wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Cauchy problem of a weighted gradient system of semilinear wave equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} u_{tt}-\Delta u=\lambda |u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta+2}u,\quad v_{tt}-\Delta v=\mu |u|^{\alpha+2}|v|^{\beta}v,\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^d,\ t\in \mathbb{R},\\ u(x,0)=u_{10}(x),\ u_t(x,0)=u_{20}(x),\quad v(x,0)=v_{10}(x),\ v_t(x,0)=v_{20}(x),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^d. \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} Here $d\geq 3$, $\lambda, \mu\in \mathbb{R}$, $\alpha, \beta\geq 0$, $(u_{10},u_{20})$ and $(v_{10},v_{20})$ belong to $H^1(\mathbb{R}^d)\oplus L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ or $\dot{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^d)\oplus L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ or $\dot{H}^{\gamma}(\mathbb{R}^d)\oplus H^{\gamma-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for some $\gamma&gt;1$. Under certain assumptions, we establish the local wellposedness of the $H^1\oplus H^1$-solution, $\dot{H}^1\oplus \dot{H}^1$-solution and $\dot{H}^{\gamma}\oplus \dot{H}^{\gamma}$-solution of the system with different types of initial data.</description>

      <title>Invariants of flat connections on 4-manifolds from Hopf group-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given group $G$, we construct an invariant of flat $G$-connections on 4-manifolds from a finite type involutory quasitriangular Hopf $G$-algebra. Hopf $G$-algebras are generalizations of Hopf algebras, equipped with gradings by $G$. In our construction, we color the dotted components of a Kirby diagram with elements of $G$ and employ the Hennings-type procedure. When $G$ is finite, we also define an invariant of 4-manifolds by summing the invariants over all flat $G$-connections.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Nonlocal Approximation to Manifold Poisson Models with Neumann Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05888v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of nonlocal models to approximate the Poisson model on manifolds with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, where the manifolds are assumed to be embedded in high dimensional Euclid spaces.
  In comparison to the existing nonlocal approximation of Poisson models with Neumann boundary, we optimize the truncation error of model by adding an augmented function involving the second order normal derivative along the $2\delta$ layer of boundary, with $2\delta$ be the nonlocal interaction horizon. The 2nd normal derivative is expressed as the difference between the interior Laplacian and the boundary Laplacian.
  The concentration of our paper is on the construction of nonlocal model, the well-posedness of model, and its second-order convergence rate to its local counterpart. The localization rate of our nonlocal model is currently optimal among all related works even for the case of high dimensional Euclid spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present characterizations of the sets of key polynomials and abstract key polynomials for a valuation $\mu$ of $K(x)$, in terms of (ultrametric) balls in the algebraic closure $\overline K$ of $K$ with respect to $v$, a fixed extension of $\mu_{\mid K}$ to $\overline K$. In particular, we show that the ways of augmenting $\mu$, in the sense of Mac Lane, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partition of a fixed closed ball $B(a,\delta)$ associated to $\mu$ into the disjoint union of open balls $B^\circ(a_i,\delta)$, modulo the action of the decomposition group of $v$. We also present a similar characterization for the set of limit key polynomials for an increasing family of valuations of $K(x)$.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology with support in Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</description>

Abstract: We show an example of a sequence of elliptic operators in the unit ball with drifts that diverge as the inverse distance to the boundary, for which we do not get uniform upper estimates for the Green's function with the pole at the origin. Such drifts have been considered in the literature in the study of the $L^{p}$ Dirichlet problem for both the parabolic and elliptic operators. Our construction provides a counterexample to an earlier claim of Hofmann and Lewis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of parabolic quasilinear systems, in which the diffusion matrix is not uniformly elliptic, but satisfies a Petrovskii condition of positivity of the real part of the eigenvalues. Local well-posedness is known since the work of Amann in the 90s, by a semi-group method. We first revisit these results in the context of Sobolev spaces modelled on $L^2$ and then explore the endpoint Besov case $B_{p,1}^{d/p}$. We also exemplify our method on the SKT system, showing the existence of local, non-negative, strong solutions.</description>

      <title>The jump filter in the discontinuous Galerkin method for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When simulating hyperbolic conservation laws with discontinuous solutions, high-order linear numerical schemes often produce undesirable spurious oscillations. In this paper, we propose a jump filter within the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to mitigate these oscillations. This filter operates locally based on jump information at cell interfaces, targeting high-order polynomial modes within each cell. Besides its localized nature, our proposed filter preserves key attributes of the DG method, including conservation, $L^2$ stability, and high-order accuracy. We also explore its compatibility with other damping techniques, and demonstrate its seamless integration into a hybrid limiter. In scenarios featuring strong shock waves, this hybrid approach, incorporating this jump filter as the low-order limiter, effectively suppresses numerical oscillations while exhibiting low numerical dissipation. Additionally, the proposed jump filter maintains the compactness of the DG scheme, which greatly aids in efficient parallel computing. Moreover, it boasts an impressively low computational cost, given that no characteristic decomposition is required and all computations are confined to physical space. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed scheme, confirming its accuracy and shock-capturing capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the data-sparsity of the solution of Riccati equations with applications to feedback control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving large-scale continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations is a significant challenge in various control theory applications. This work demonstrates that when the matrix coefficients of the equation are quasiseparable, the solution also exhibits numerical quasiseparability. This property enables us to develop two efficient Riccati solvers. The first solver is applicable to the general quasiseparable case, while the second is tailored to the particular case of banded coefficients. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both synthetic examples and case studies from the control of partial differential equations and agent-based models.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <title>A note for double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof for the interior double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of the Euler Equations in a bounded $C^2$-domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$; $d\geq 3$. That is, for velocity $u \in C^{0,\gamma}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^d)$ with some $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1/2$, we show that the pressure $p \in C^{0,2\gamma}_{\rm int}(\Omega)$. This is motivated by the studies of turbulence and anomalous dissipation in mathematical hydrodynamics and, recently, has been established in [L. De Rosa, M. Latocca, and G. Stefani, Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024.3 (2024), 2511--2560] over $C^{2,1}$-domains by means of pseudodifferential calculus. Our approach involves only standard elliptic PDE techniques, and relies on a variant of the modified pressure introduced in [C. W. Bardos, D. W. Boutros, and E. S. Titi, H\"{o}lder regularity of the pressure for weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations in bounded domains, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 249 (2025), 28] and the potential estimates in [L. Silvestre, unpublished notes]. The key novel ingredient of our proof is the introduction of two cutoff functions whose localisation parameters are carefully chosen as a power of the distance to $\partial\Omega$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over rings which are "combinations of discrete algebras and affinoid $\mathbb{Q}_p$-algebras", and prove basic results such as the existence of a fully faithful functor from the category of Galois representations, the deperfection of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over perfect period rings, and the dualizability of the cohomology of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules, and the classification of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules of rank $1$. This work is motivated by the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence for locally analytic representations, as proposed by Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, and the $GL_1$ case, as formulated and proved by Rodrigues Jacinto-Rodr\'iguez Camargo.</description>

      <title>On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of PI-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries. These include, for example, superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic $0$, and a topological space $X$. We construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the structure sheaf takes values in the $G$-graded variety $\mathbf{G\text{-}var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$. This provides a framework that classifies geometric spaces whose local models belong to $\mathbf{G\text{-}var}(A)$. We study conditions under which two such geometries can be compared in a (graded) Morita context, as well as the compatibility of their corresponding differential calculi. As an application, we prove a Morita-equivariant Betti/Riemann--Hilbert theorem: varying the coefficients along the Morita $(2,1)$-groupoid, the fixed-coefficient equivalences are compatible with transport and hence induce a biequivalence of Grothendieck totals.</description>

      <title>OD-Stega: LLM-Based Relatively Secure Steganography via Optimized Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to generate stego-texts in combination with arithmetic coding. An efficient method should embed secret bits in as few language tokens as possible while keeping the stego-text as natural as possible. We show that this problem is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the divergence between the new distribution and the original one produced by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided under either the KL divergence or the total variation constraint. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The incorporation of the proposed approach with existing (potentially non arithmetic coding based) techniques, e.g., the Discop technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish some new combinatorial properties of elements in Coxeter groups. Firstly, we generalise Reading's theorem on the canonical join representations of elements in finite Coxeter groups to all finitely generated Coxeter groups.
  Secondly, we show that for any element $x$ in a Coxeter group $W$ and root $\beta$ in its inversion set $\Phi(x)$, the set of elements $y \in W$ satisfying $\Phi(x) \cap \Phi(y) = \{ \beta \} $ is convex in the weak order and admits a unique minimal representative. This is strongly connected to determining the cone type of elements of $W$ and leads to efficient computational methods to determine whether arbitrary elements of $W$ have the same cone type.</description>

Abstract: A base for a finite permutation group $G \le \mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ is a subset of $\Omega$ with trivial pointwise stabiliser in $G$, and the base size of $G$ is the smallest size of a base for $G$. Motivated by the interest in groups of base size two, Burness and Giudici introduced the notion of the Saxl graph. This graph has vertex set $\Omega$, with edges between elements if they form a base for $G$. We define a generalisation of this graph that encodes useful information about $G$ whenever $b(G) \ge 2$: here, the edges are the pairs of elements of $\Omega$ that can be extended to bases of size $b(G)$. In particular, for primitive groups, we investigate the completeness and arc-transitivity of the generalised graph, and the generalisation of Burness and Giudici's Common Neighbour Conjecture on the original Saxl graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the set of locally finite Borel graphs with finite Borel asymptotic dimension is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete. The result is based on a combinatorial characterization of finite Borel asymptotic dimension for graphs generated by a single Borel function. As an application of this characterization, we classify the complexities of digraph homomorphism problems for this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for the mixing time of the Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the mixing time of the Facilitated Exclusion Process (FEP) and obtain cutoff and pre-cutoff in different regimes. The main tool to obtain this result is a new bijective, deterministic mapping between the joint law of an ergodic FEP and its current through the origin, and the joint law of a Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP) and its current through the origin. This mapping is interesting in itself, as it remains valid in the non-ergodic regime where it gives a coupling between the position of a tagged particle in the FEP and the current through the origin in a SSEP with traps.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotics of Orthogonal Polynomials on Multiple Intervals with Non-Analytic Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas-Its-Kitaev Riemann-Hilbert problem using the Deift-Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\overline{\partial}$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that give similar rates while allowing less regular perturbations. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be differentiable with bounded second derivative.</description>

      <title>Identities involving additive maps on division rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $g$ be an additive map on a division ring $D$. In this paper, we study the functional identity $G_{1}(y)g(y)G_{2}(y) = H(y)$, where $G_{1}(Y), G_{2}(Y)$, $H(Y)$ are generalized polynomials in $D_{G}[Y]$ such that both $G_{1}(Y)$ and $G_{2}(Y)$ are non-zero. By application of this result and its implications, we prove that if $D$ is a non-commutative division ring with $\operatorname{char}(D) \neq 2$, then the only possible solution of additive maps $g_{1},g_{2}: D \rightarrow D$ satisfying the identity $g_{1}(y)y^{-m} + y^{n}g_{2}(y^{-1})= 0$ is $ g_{1} = g_{2} = 0$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $(m,n) \neq (1,1)$.</description>

      <title>On finite dimensional regular gradings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an associative algebra over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic 0. A decomposition $A=A_1\oplus\cdots \oplus A_r$ of $A$ into a direct sum of $r$ vector subspaces is called a \textsl{regular decomposition} if, for every $n$ and every $1\le i_j\le r$, there exist $a_{i_j}\in A_{i_j}$ such that $a_{i_1}\cdots a_{i_n}\ne 0$, and moreover, for every $1\le i,j\le r$ there exists a constant $\beta(i,j)\in K^*$ such that $a_ia_j=\beta(i,j)a_ja_i$ for every $a_i\in A_i$, $a_j\in A_j$. We work with decompositions determined by gradings on $A$ by a finite abelian group $G$. In this case, the function $\beta\colon G\times G\to K^*$ ought to be a bicharacter. A regular decomposition is {minimal} whenever for every $g$, $h\in G$, the equalities $\beta(x,g)=\beta(x,h)$ for every $x\in G$ imply $g=h$. In this paper we describe completely the structure of the finite dimensional algebras $A$ (with unit) admitting a $G$-regular grading. Moreover, we compute the graded codimension sequence for a class of such algebras assuming complete support and minimal regular decomposition. It turns out that, for these algebras, the graded PI-exponent coincides with the ordinary (ungraded) PI-exponent. Finally, we show that the regular decomposition of a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ with a regular $G$-grading is minimal if and only if $\exp(A)=|G|$.</description>

      <title>On the additive image of 0th persistent homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $X$ a finite category and $F$ a finite field, we study the additive image of the functor $\operatorname{H}_0(-,F) \colon \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Top}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$, or equivalently, of the free functor $\operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Set}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$.
  We characterize all finite categories $X$ for which the indecomposables in the additive image coincide with the indecomposable indicator representations and provide examples of quivers of wild representation type where the additive image contains only finitely many indecomposables. Motivated by questions in topological data analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the additive image for finite grids. In particular, we show that for grids of infinite representation type, there exist infinitely many indecomposables both within and outside the additive image.
  We develop an algorithm for determining if a representation of a finite category is in the additive image. In addition, we investigate conditions for realizability and the effect of modifications of the source category and the underlying field.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of the additive image of $\operatorname{H}_n(-,F)$ for an arbitrary field $F$, extending previous work for prime fields.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Error Estimation Improved by a Reconstruction Operator for the Stokes Optimal Control Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a posteriori error estimates for a pressure-robust finite element method, which incorporates a divergence-free reconstruction operator, within the context of the distributed optimal control problem constrained by the Stokes equations. We develop an enhanced residual-based a posteriori error estimator that is independent of pressure and establish its global reliability and efficiency. The proposed a posteriori error estimator enables the separation of velocity and pressure errors in a posteriori error estimation, ensuring velocity-related estimates are free of pressure influence. Numerical experiments confirm our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Counting domino and lozenge tilings of reduced domains with Pad\'{e}-type approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for studying gap probabilities in a class of discrete determinantal point processes with double contour integral kernels. This class of point processes includes uniform measures of domino and lozenge tilings as well as their doubly periodic generalizations. We use a Fourier series approach to simplify the form of the kernels and to characterize gap probabilities in terms of Riemann-Hilbert problems.
  As a first illustration of our approach, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of domino tilings of reduced Aztec diamonds in terms of Pad\'e approximants, by solving the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem explicitly. As a second application, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of lozenge tilings of (simply connected) reduced hexagons in terms of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants. For more complicated domains, such as hexagons with holes, the number of tilings involves a generalization of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants.</description>

      <title>Performance bound analysis of linear consensus algorithm on strongly connected graphs using effective resistance and reversiblization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of the linear consensus algorithm on strongly connected directed graphs using the linear quadratic (LQ) cost as a performance measure. In particular, we derive bounds on the LQ cost by leveraging effective resistance and reversiblization. Our results extend previous analyses-which were limited to reversible cases-to the nonreversible setting. To facilitate this generalization, we introduce novel concepts, termed the back-and-forth path and the pivot node, which serve as effective alternatives to traditional techniques that require reversibility. Moreover, we apply our approach to Cayley graphs and random geometric graphs to estimate the LQ cost without the reversibility assumption. The proposed approach provides a framework that can be adapted to other contexts where reversibility is typically assumed.</description>

      <title>On the Bogomolov-Positselski Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. An oriented pro-$p$ group $(G,\theta)$ is said to have the Bogomolov--Positselski property if it is Kummerian and if $I_\theta(G)$ is a free pro-$p$ group. In this paper, we provide a new criterion for an oriented pro-$p$ group to satisfy the Bogomolov--Positselski property. This criterion builds on earlier work of Positselski (arXiv:1405.0965) and Quadrelli--Weigel (arXiv:2103.12438), relates their approaches, and answers a question raised in (arXiv:2103.12438).
  Under additional assumptions, we obtain two further sufficient criteria. The first is analogous to a Merkurjev--Suslin type statement. The second allows one to weaken the hypotheses appearing in Positselski's criterion (arXiv:1405.0965 Theorem 2). Finally, we show that the stronger conditions are satisfied by pro-$p$ groups of elementary type. As a consequence, the Elementary Type Conjecture implies Positselski's ``Module Koszulity Conjecture 1'' (arXiv:1008.0095) for fields with finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sectional curvature bounds are of central importance in the study of Riemannian manifolds, both in smooth differential geometry and in the generalized synthetic setting of Alexandrov spaces. Riemannian metrics along with metric spaces of bounded sectional curvature enjoy a variety of, oftentimes rigid, geometric properties. The purpose of this article is to introduce and discuss a new notion of sectional curvature bounds for manifolds equipped with continuous Riemannian metrics of Geroch--Traschen regularity, i.e., $H^1_{\mathrm{loc}} \cap C^0$, based on a distributional version of the classical formula. Our main result states that for $g \in C^1$, this new notion recovers the corresponding bound based on triangle comparison in the sense of Alexandrov. A weaker version of this statement is also proven for locally Lipschitz continuous metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems with uncertainty sets consisting of high-dimensional random vectors that are close in the multivariate Wasserstein distance to a reference random vector. We give conditions when the images of these sets under scalar-valued aggregation functions are contained in and contain uncertainty sets of univariate random variables defined via a univariate Wasserstein distance. This provides lower and upper bounds for the solution to general multivariate DRO problems that are computationally tractable. Furthermore, we generalize the results to uncertainty sets characterized by Bregman-Wasserstein divergences, which allows for asymmetric deviations from the reference random vector. Moreover, for DRO problems with risk measure criterion in the class of signed Choquet integrals, we derive semi-analytic formulae for the upper and lower bounds and the distribution that attains these bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article is concerned with the s*-compressibility of classical boundary integral operators in anisotropic wavelet coordinates. Having the s*-compressibility at hand, one can design adaptive wavelet algorithms which are asymptotically optimal, meaning that any target accuracy can be achieved at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of degrees of freedom (within the setting determined by an underlying wavelet basis) that would ideally be necessary for realising that target accuracy if full knowledge about the unknown solution were given. As we consider anisotropic wavelet bases, we can achieve higher convergence rates compared to the standard, isotropic setting. Especially, edge singularities of anisotropic nature can be resolved.</description>

Abstract: A common approach to approximating quadratic forms of matrix functions is to use a quadrature rule derived from the Lanczos process, known as a Lanczos quadrature. Although symmetric quadrature rules are computationally favorable, it has remained unclear whether a symmetric Lanczos quadrature is practically feasible. In this work, we resolve this ambiguity by establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of symmetric Lanczos quadratures. We show that the sufficient condition can be met for a class of Jordan-Wielandt matrices by carefully constructing initial vectors with specific distributions for the Lanczos algorithm. Applying such a symmetric Lanczos quadrature to compute the Estrada index of bipartite or directed graphs ensures that the resulting stochastic trace estimators are unbiased. Furthermore, we observe that the variance of the quadratic form estimator based on the symmetric Lanczos quadrature is lower than that of the standard estimator.</description>

      <title>High-Order Hermite Optimization: Fast and Exact Gradient Computation in Open-Loop Quantum Optimal Control using a Discrete Adjoint Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the High-Order Hermite Optimization (HOHO) method, an open-loop discrete adjoint method for quantum optimal control. Our method is the first of its kind to efficiently compute exact (discrete) gradients when using continuous, parameterized control pulses while solving the forward equations (e.g. Schrodinger's equation or the Linblad master equation) with an arbitrarily high-order Hermite Runge-Kutta method. The HOHO method is implemented in QuantumGateDesign$.$jl (https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl), an open-source software package for the Julia programming language, which we use to perform numerical experiments comparing the method to Juqbox$.$jl (https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl). For realistic model problems we observe speedups up to 775x.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of difference of multiplicative and additive characters modulo $p$ at consecutive polynomial values. More precisely, for an interval $I$ over finite field and $0&lt;m&lt;1$, we investigate the following sums \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\in I}|\psi(F(n))-\psi(F(n+1))|^{2m} \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n\in I}|\chi(F(n))-\chi(F(n+1))|^{2m}, \end{align*} where $\psi$ is a non-trivial additive character and $\chi$ is a non-trivial multiplicative character modulo $p$, under suitable conditions on $\chi$ and $F$. As a consequence, we derive a formula for the first moment by specializing to $m=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation with $p&gt;2$ in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition corresponding to the total mass conservation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution by the Galerkin method in evolving Bochner spaces and a monotonicity argument. The main difficulty is in characterizing the weak limit of the nonlinear gradient term, where we need to deal with a term which comes from the boundary condition and cannot be absorbed into a monotone operator. To overcome this difficulty, we prove a uniform-in-time Friedrichs type inequality on a moving domain with time-dependent basis functions and make use of it to get the strong convergence of approximate solutions. We also show that the time derivative exists in the $L^2$ sense when given data have a better regularity, and discuss extension of the existence and uniqueness results to a Leray-Lions type operator.</description>

Abstract: Using a description of the spectrum of bidual algebra $A^{**}$ of a uniform algebra $A$ we obtain abstract corona theorem for certain uniform algebras. It asserts the density of a specific Gleason part in the spectrum of an $H^\infty$ -- type subalgebra of $A^{**}$.
  There is an isometric isomorphism of the latter subalgebra with $H^\infty(G)$ for a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$. Using abstract corona theorem we show the density of the canonical image of $G$ in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$, solving positively corona problem for such domains. In particular, we obtain positive solution for balls and polydisks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearly distributive categories (LDC), introduced by Cockett and Seely to model multiplicative linear logic, are categories equipped with two monoidal structures that interact via linear distributivities. A seminal result in monoidal category theory is the Fox theorem, which characterizes cartesian categories as symmetric monoidal categories whose objects are equipped with canonical comonoid structures. The aim of this work is to extend the Fox theorem to LDCs and characterize the subclass of cartesian linearly distributive categories (CLDC). To do so, we introduce medial linearly distributive categories (MLDC), medial linear functors, and medial linear transformations. The former are LDCs which respect the logical medial rule, appearing frequently in deep inference, or alternatively are the appropriate structure at the intersection of LDCs and duoidal categories.</description>

      <title>On pure monomorphisms and pure epimorphisms in accessible categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In all $\kappa$-accessible additive categories, $\kappa$-pure monomorphisms and $\kappa$-pure epimorphisms are well-behaved, as shown in our previous paper arXiv:2311.02418. This is known to be not always true in $\kappa$-accessible nonadditive categories. Nevertheless, mild assumptions on a $\kappa$-accessible category are sufficient to prove good properties of $\kappa$-pure monomorphisms and $\kappa$-pure epimorphisms. In particular, in a $\kappa$-accessible category with finite products, all $\kappa$-pure monomorphisms are $\kappa$-directed colimits of split monomorphisms, while in a $\kappa$-accessible category with finite coproducts, all $\kappa$-pure epimorphisms are $\kappa$-directed colimits of split epimorphisms. We also discuss what we call Quillen exact classes of monomorphisms and epimorphisms, generalizing the additive concept of one-sided exact category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic model that couples the movement of a population of individuals with the dynamics of a pathogen in the same population. We consider that transmission occurs when a susceptible and an infectious individual are sufficiently close for a sufficiently long time. We show that the model is formally compatible with the well-known SIRS model in mathematical epidemiology. Namely, after identifying an appropriate dimensionless variable and considering the limit when that variable is small, we introduce a partial differential equation model of advection-drift-diffusion type (mesoscopic model), which for spatially homogeneous solutions reduces to the SIRS model. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions in appropriate spaces for particular instances of the model. We finish with some examples and discuss possible applications and generalisation of this modelling approach, linking kinetic models, evolutionary game theory, and mathematical epidemiology.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the need to relate the biparameter persistence module induced by a pair of scalar functions with the monoparameter persistence modules induced by each function separately, we introduce a construction that defines a kind of product between two monoparameter persistence modules. While originally conceived to serve this comparative purpose, our construction unexpectedly reveals a deeper structural property: it also characterizes a class of biparameter modules known as hook-decomposable modules.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some interesting properties of the fixed point sequence of the Josephus function $J_3$. First, we establish a connection between this sequence and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Next, we identify a clear numerical pattern for the digits of two consecutive fixed points when they are written in a non-standard fractional number system in base $3/2$. This result allows us to derive a recursive procedure for determining the digits of their base $3/2$ expansions.</description>

Furthermore, we establish an explicit formula, called the Langlands branching rule, which gives the multiplicities in the decomposition of the character of a snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ into a sum of characters of irreducible representations of its Langlands dual algebra.</description>

Abstract: We study a fluid-structure interaction problem between a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic beam with fixed endpoints in a static setting. The 3D fluid domain is bounded, nonsmooth and non simply connected, the fluid is modeled by the stationary Navier-Stokes equations subject to inflow/outflow conditions. The structure is modeled by a stationary 1D beam equation with a load density involving the force exerted by the fluid and, thereby, may vary its position. In a smallness regime, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the PDE-ODE coupled system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This $2^{nd}$-edition article is intended to be an up-to-date archive of the current state of the questions: Which finitely generated groups $G$: have semistable fundamental group at infinity; are simply connected at infinity; are such that $H^2(G,\mathbb ZG)$ is free abelian or trivial. The idea is not to reprove these results, but to provide a historical record of the progress on these questions and provide a list of the most general results. We also prove or cite all of the results that make up the basic theory. The first Chapter is devoted to ends of groups and spaces, and the second to semistability at infinity, simple connectivity at infinity and second cohomology of groups. Definitions, basic facts and lists of general results are given in each Chapter. A number of results proven here are new and a number of authors have contributed results. We end with an Index for simply connected at infinity groups and an Index of Groups and Subgroups which is intended to help a reader quickly locate results about certain types of groups/subgroups. The main updates from the first edition is section 2.4.5 on mapping class groups and the addition of the simply connected at infinity index.</description>

      <title>Character theoretic techniques for nonabelian partial difference sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda, \mu)$-partial difference set (PDS) is a subset $D$ of size $k$ of a group $G$ of order $v$ such that every nonidentity element $g$ of $G$ can be expressed in either $\lambda$ or $\mu$ different ways as a product $xy^{-1}$, $x, y \in D$, depending on whether or not $g$ is in $D$. If $D$ is inverse closed and $1 \notin D$, then the Cayley graph ${\rm Cay}(G,D)$ is a $(v,k,\lambda, \mu)$-strongly regular graph (SRG). PDSs have been studied extensively over the years, especially in abelian groups, where techniques from character theory have proven to be particularly effective. Recently, there has been considerable interest in studying PDSs in nonabelian groups, and the purpose of this paper is develop character theoretic techniques that apply in the nonabelian setting. We prove that analogues of character theoretic results of Ott about generalized quadrangles of order $s$ also hold in the general PDS setting, and we are able to use these techniques to compute the intersection of a putative PDS with the conjugacy classes of the parent group in many instances. With these techniques, we are able to prove the nonexistence of PDSs in numerous instances and provide severe restrictions in cases when such PDSs may still exist. Furthermore, we are able to use these techniques constructively, computing several examples of PDSs in nonabelian groups not previously recognized in the literature, including an infinite family of genuinely nonabelian PDSs associated to the block-regular Steiner triple systems originally studied by Clapham and related infinite families of genuinely nonabelian PDSs associated to the block-regular Steiner $2$-designs first studied by Wilson.</description>

      <title>Counting Zeros of Complex-Valued Harmonic Functions via Rouch\'e's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rouch\'e's Theorem is among the most useful results in complex analysis for counting zeros of analytic functions. Rouch\'e's Theorem also admits a harmonic analogue for counting zeros of complex harmonic functions. Previously, this analogue has been applied primarily to closed curves of simple geometry, such as circles, to count zeros. We demonstrate that non-circular critical curves can serve as effective contours by applying a harmonic Rouch\'e-type argument to determine the total number of zeros of the complex harmonic family given by $f(z) = z^n + az^k + b\overline{z}^k - 1 $, where $n&gt;k\geq1$ and $a,b &gt; 0$. Under explicit inequalities relating $a$ and $b$, we determine the total number of zeros is either $n$ or $n+2k$ (counted with multiplicity). We also prove the zeros of $f$ are confined to the union of two explicit annuli in the plane: an inner annulus containing $k$ zeros and an outer annulus containing the remainder.</description>

      <title>A convex polyhedron without Rupert's property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-dimensional convex body is said to have Rupert's property if its copy can be passed through a straight hole inside that body. In this work we construct a polyhedron which is provably not Rupert, thus we disprove a conjecture from 2017. We also find a polyhedron that is Rupert but not locally Rupert.</description>

      <title>Nagumo-Type Characterization of Forward Invariance for Constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Nagumo-type invariance condition for differential inclusions defined on closed constraint sets. More specifically, given a closed set to render forward invariant, the proposed condition restricts the system's dynamics, assumed to be locally Lipschitz, on the boundary of the set restricted to the interior of the constraint set. In particular, when the boundary of the set is entirely within the interior of the constraint set, the proposed condition reduces to the well-known Nagumo condition, known to be necessary and sufficient for forward invariance in this case. This being said, the proposed condition is only necessary in the general setting. As a result, we provide a set of additional assumptions relating the constrained system to the set to render forward invariant, and restricting to the geometry at the intersection between the two sets, so that the equivalence holds. The importance of the proposed assumptions is illustrated via examples.</description>

      <title>Depth Preservation and Close-Field Transfer in the Local Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a revised notion of depth for Langlands parameters for tori defined over a nonarchimedean local field \(F\) that restores depth preservation under the local Langlands correspondence (LLC). We leverage that preservation to derive structural results that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad harmonic-analytic results from characteristic \(0\) to characteristic \(p\). When \(F\) has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block equivalence: each Bernstein block of \(G(F)\) is equivalent to a corresponding block for some \(G'(F')\) with \(F'\) of characteristic \(0\) \(\ell\)-close to \(F\); using this, we show that a LLC in characteristic \(0\) corresponds canonically to a LLC in characteristic \(p\). For regular supercuspidals we give a direct, more structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend results on \(\ell\)-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function generalizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated isomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth and supercuspidality preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for arbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a generalized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby subsuming several earlier results in the literature. Collectively, the results let one work in characteristic \(0\) without loss of generality for a wide swath of harmonic analysis on \(p\)-adic groups.</description>

      <title>Resolvent Compositions for Positive Linear Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolvent compositions were recently introduced as monotonicity-preserving operations that combine a set-valued monotone operator and a bounded linear operator. They generalize in particular the notion of a resolvent average. We analyze the resolvent compositions when the monotone operator is a positive linear operator. We establish several new properties, including L\"owner partial order relations, concavity, and asymptotic behavior. In addition, we show that the resolvent composition operations are nonexpansive with respect to the Thompson metric. We also introduce a new form of geometric interpolation and explore its connections to resolvent compositions. Finally, we study two nonlinear equations based on resolvent compositions.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence of three unique ``max-exparabolas'' to a triangle. Each of these parabolas is internally tangent to one edge and the two other sides. Among all like parabolas, it is characterized by having maximal parameter. We use this result to prove a more general uniqueness statement on maximal parabolas in a convex point set. In similar spirit, we demonstrate uniqueness of minimal enclosing horocycles in hyperbolic geometry, provided the enclosed set is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Bregman Stochastic Proximal Point Algorithm with Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic algorithms, especially stochastic gradient descent (SGD), have proven to be the go-to methods in data science and machine learning. In recent years, the stochastic proximal point algorithm (SPPA) emerged, and it was shown to be more robust than SGD with respect to stepsize settings. However, SPPA still suffers from a decreased convergence rate due to the need for vanishing stepsizes, which is resolved by using variance reduction methods. In the deterministic setting, there are many problems that can be solved more efficiently when viewing them in a non-Euclidean geometry using Bregman distances. This paper combines these two worlds and proposes variance reduction techniques for the Bregman stochastic proximal point algorithm (BSPPA). As special cases, we obtain SAGA- and SVRG-like variance reduction techniques for BSPPA. Our theoretical and numerical results demonstrate improved stability and convergence rates compared to the vanilla BSPPA with constant and vanishing stepsizes, respectively. Our analysis, also, allow to recover the same variance reduction techniques for Bregman SGD in a unified way.</description>

Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polyhedral K\"ahler metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ whose singular set is a hyperplane arrangement and whose cone angles are in $(0, 2\pi)$. These conditions take the form of linear and quadratic constraints on the cone angles and are entirely determined by the intersection poset of the arrangement. Our proof of existence relies on a parabolic version of the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, due to T. Mochizuki.</description>

      <title>Edge Collaborative Gaussian Splatting with Integrated Rendering and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting (GS) struggles with degraded rendering quality on low-cost devices. To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS), where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO) algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution capability of ILO.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional flying wing Steady Ricci Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $n\geq 4$, we construct an $(n-2)$-parameter family of steady gradient Ricci solitons with non-negative curvature operator and prescribed by the eigenvalues of Ricci tensor at a critical point of the soliton potential. Among them lies an $(n-3)$-parameter subfamily of non-collapsed solitons. These solitons generalized the flying wings constructed by the second named author and produced new examples of steady gradient Ricci solitons with non-negative curvature operator for $n\geq 4$. Our approach is based on constructing continuous families of Ricci flows smoothing emanating from continuous families of spherical polyhedra which still preserves symmetry.
  This is built upon a new stability result of Ricci flows with scaling invariant estimates. As another application of the method, we prove the stability of asymptotically conical expanding solitons constructed by Deruelle under $L^\infty$ perturbation of links. In particular, the $C^0$-convergence of smooth links implies the smooth convergence of the expanding solitons.</description>

      <title>Cross-Band Channel Impulse Response Prediction: Leveraging 3.5 GHz Channels for Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate cross-band channel prediction is essential for 6G networks, particularly in the upper mid-band (FR3, 7-24 GHz), where penetration loss and blockage are severe. Although ray tracing (RT) provides high-fidelity modeling, it remains computationally intensive, and high-frequency data acquisition is costly. To address these challenges, we propose CIR-UNext, a deep learning framework designed to predict 7 GHz channel impulse responses (CIRs) by leveraging abundant 3.5 GHz CIRs. The framework integrates an RT-based dataset pipeline with attention U-Net (AU-Net) variants for gain and phase prediction. The proposed AU-Net-Aux model achieves a median gain error of 0.58 dB and a phase prediction error of 0.27 rad on unseen complex environments. Furthermore, we extend CIR-UNext into a foundation model, Channel2ComMap, for throughput prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems, demonstrating superior performance compared with existing approaches. Overall, CIR-UNext provides an efficient and scalable solution for cross-band prediction, enabling applications such as localization, beam management, digital twins, and intelligent resource allocation in 6G networks.</description>

Abstract: We study homeomorphisms and the homeomorphism groups of compact metric spaces using the automorphism groups of projective Fra\"iss\'e limits. In our applications, we investigate the Polish group ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ of all homeomorphisms of the pseudoarc $P$ using the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(\mathbb{P})$ of the pre-pseudoarc $\mathbb{P}$. Strengthening results from the literature, we show that the diagonal conjugacy action of ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ on ${\rm Homeo}(P)^{\mathbb{N}}$ has a dense orbit. In our second application, we show that there exists a homeomorphism of $P$ that is not conjugate in ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ to an element of ${\rm Aut}(\mathbb{P})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we build a geometric model for the renormalisation of irrationally indifferent fixed points of holomorphic maps with two critical points. The model incorporates arithmetic properties of the rotation number at the fixed point, as well as the "angle" between the two critical points. Using this model for the renormalisation, we build a topological model for the local dynamics of such maps. We also explain the topology of the maximal invariant set for the model, and the dynamics of the map on the maximal invariant set.</description>

As an application, we obtain the $C_n^1$ property for the field $\mathbf{F}_p(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$.</description>

      <title>CLT for $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights, application to the KLS conjecture in Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the $\beta$-ensembles (or 1D log-gas) with Freud weights, namely with a potential of the form $|x|^{p}$ with $p \geq 2$. Since this potential is not of class $\mathcal{C}^{3}$ when $p \in (2,3]$, most of the literature does not apply. In this singular setting, we prove a central limit theorem for linear statistics with general test-functions. Our strategy relies on establishing an optimal local law in the spirit of [Bourgade, Mody, Pain 22'. Our results allow us to give a consistency check of the KLS conjecture for the uniform distributions on $p$-Schatten balls and the functions $f(X)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(X^r\right)^q$. While the case $p&gt;3$, $q=1$, $r=2$ was proven in [Dadoun, Fradelizi, Gu\'edon, Zitt 23'], we address in the present paper the case $p\geq2$, $q\geq1$ and $r\geq2$ an even integer. The proofs are based on a link between the moments of norms of uniform laws on $p$-Schatten balls and the $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact space $X$ that does not admit an embedding (an injective continuous function) into $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the ''degree'' of discontinuity that any injective function $X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ must have. To this end, we define a scale invariant modulus of discontinuity and obtain general lower bounds, thus obtaining quantified nonembeddability results of Haefliger--Weber type. Moreover, we establish analogous lower bounds for simplicial complexes that do not admit an almost $r$-embedding in $\mathbb{R}^d$, thus obtaining a quantified version of the topological Tverberg theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnitude of metric spaces does not appear to possess a simple, convenient continuity property, and previous studies have presented affirmative results under additional constraints or weaker notions, as well as counterexamples. In this vein, we discuss the continuity of magnitude of finite positive definite metric spaces with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, but with a restriction of the domain based on a canonical partition of a sufficiently small neighborhood of a finite metric space. As a result, the main theorem of this article explains a condition on the cardinality of metric spaces that determines the continuity of magnitude. This study takes advantage of the geometric interpretation of magnitude as the circumradius of the corresponding finite Euclidean subset. Such a transformation is especially useful for constructing counterexamples, as we can depend on Euclidean geometric intuition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new bifurcation in Hamiltonian systems, which we call the double flip bifurcation. The Hamiltonian depends on two parameters, one of which controls the double flip bifurcation. The result of the bifurcation is the occurrence of two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations with respect to the other parameter. The two Hamiltonian flip bifurcations are simultaneous with respect to the first parameter, and are connected by a curve-segment of singular points. We find a normal form for Hamiltonians describing systems going through double flip bifurcations, and compute said normal form for some examples.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of relations on a level 5 module over the twisted affine Lie algebra $A_2^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complete toric variety. We give a criterion to decide whether $X$ decomposes as a product of complete toric varieties by analyzing the $1$-skeleton of its fan. More precisely, we prove that any direct-sum decomposition of the 1-skeleton induces a corresponding direct-sum decomposition of the fan itself. As an application, we show that if the identity component of the automorphism group is semisimple, then $X$ must be a product of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Augmentation and Bulk Edge Correspondence for one dimensional aperiodic tight binding operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a particular class of 1D aperiodic models with the aim to understand how their internal degrees of freedom contribute to their topological invariants and the possible relations (correspondences) among them. In order to handle models with finite local complexity we introduce the principle of augmentation. This allows us to relate the values of the Integrated Density of States at gap energies for the bulk system to spectral flows. We consider two different augmentations. The first is based on the mapping torus construction. It leads to an alternative proof of the result that the gap labelling group of Bellissard coincides with that of Johnson-Moser. It furthermore allows for an interpretation of the spectral flow via boundary forces. The second augmentation applies to models obtained by the cut and project method where we find for 2-cut models two different spectral flows, one attached to the edge modes and related to the phason motion whereas the other is an augmented bulk invariant. Our approach is based on the well-established $C^*$-algebraic approach to solid state physics and the description of topological invariants by $K$-theory and cyclic cocycles. We also present numerical simulations to illustrate our theorems.</description>

      <title>Neural Policy Composition from Free Energy Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability.</description>

      <title>Integral cluster structures on quantized coordinate rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop (quantum) cluster algebra structures over arbitrary commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$ and prove that the (quantized) coordinate rings of connected simply-connected complex simple algebraic groups $G$ over $\Bbbk$ admit such structures. We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}'$, where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>Subsampling Confidence Bound for Persistent Diagram via Time-delay Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay embedding is a fundamental technique in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for reconstructing the phase space dynamics of time-series data. Persistent homology effectively identifies global topological features, such as loops associated with periodicity. Nevertheless, a statistically rigorous way to quantify uncertainty in the resulting topological features has remained underdeveloped -- a problem that we aim to challenge. First, we analyze the topological characterization of time-delay embeddings under both periodic and non-periodic conditions. Precisely, the embedded trajectory is homotopy equivalent to a circle ($S^1$) for periodic signals and is contractible for non-periodic ones. We also prove that the reach of the sliding window embedding is lower-bounded, ensuring stable persistence features. Next, we propose a subsampling-based method to construct confidence bounds for persistence diagrams derived from time-delay embeddings. Specifically, we derive confidence bounds with asymptotic guarantees, under the assumption that the support satisfies standard manifold regularity. Integrating the results, we propose a statistical testing framework to determine the periodicity of the underlying sampling function. This framework provides a principled statistical test for periodicity with asymptotically controlled type I and type II error rates. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves detection performance comparable to the Generalized Lomb-Scargle Periodogram on periodic data while exhibiting superior robustness in distinguishing non-periodic signals with time-varying frequencies, such as chirp signals. Finally, it successfully captured the periodicity when applied to the BIDMC dataset.</description>

      <title>Expectations in Expectation Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.
  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.
  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.</description>

      <title>Projected Sobolev Natural Gradient Descent for Efficient Neural Network Solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a projected Sobolev natural gradient descent (NGD) method for computing ground states of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By projecting a continuous Riemannian Sobolev gradient flow onto the normalized neural network tangent space, we derive a discrete NGD algorithm that preserves the normalization constraint. The numerical implementation employs variational Monte Carlo with a hybrid sampling strategy to accurately account for the normalization constant arising from nonlinear interaction terms. To enhance computational efficiency, a matrix-free Nystr\"om-preconditioned conjugate gradient solver is adopted to approximate the NGD operator without explicit matrix assembly. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method converges significantly faster than physics-informed neural network approaches and exhibits linear scalability with respect to spatial dimensions. Moreover, the resulting neural-network solutions provide high-quality initial guesses that substantially accelerate subsequent refinement by traditional high-precision solvers.</description>

      <title>Probability measure annihilating all finite-dimensional subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is presumably a folklore result that any infinite-dimensional Banach space admits a probability measure annihilating all finite-dimensional subspaces, as the pushforward measure of an infinite product of Rademacher-type probability measures by a well-chosen random element depending on a linearly independent sequence shows. It also seems to be a generic property of probability measures which are not supported on a finite-dimensional subspace, even when the conditions of the existence of Gaussian measures on the Banach space are not met. In this short article, we provide an original method for constructing such probability measures in all generality using only an atomless probability measure on an interval of $\mathbb{R}$ instead of infinite-product measures. Anecdotally, prime numbers and one of their distribution laws are used. In the process, we show the existence of an uncountable measurable family of independent vectors having the cardinality of the continuum in any infinite-dimensional Banach space.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the paper [Got25] and studies Goldstern's principle, a principle about unions of continuum many null sets, further. The main result is that the Hausdorff measure version of Goldstern's principle for $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ sets fails in $L$, despite the fact that the Lebesgue measure version is true. Moreover, we show that this version holds provided that the measurable cardinal exists. Other various results regarding Goldstern's principle are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the expectation of the operator norm of the random matrix (a_{ij} X_{ij}) for i,j &lt;= n, under the assumption that the random variables (X_{ij}) are independent, symmetric and satisfy the moment growth condition ||X_{ij}||{2p} &lt;= C ||X_{ij}||{p} for every p &gt;= 1. We derive an upper bound expressed in terms of quantities that can be explicitly computed in many cases. This bound implies a two-sided estimate, up to a factor given by a power of an iterated logarithm. This factor is considerably smaller than the natural scale of the problem. Our result thus provides positive evidence supporting a conjecture formulated by Rafal Latala and Jan Swiatkowski.</description>

Abstract: Relation between the real eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix and those of the non-backtracking Laplacian is considered with respect to node clustering. For this purpose we use the real eigenvalues of the transition probability matrix (when the random walk goes through the oriented edges with the rule of ``not going back in the next step'') which have a linear relation to those of the non-backtracking Laplacian of Jost and Mulas. ``Inflation--deflation'' techniques are also developed for clustering the nodes of the non-backtracking graph. With further processing, it leads to the clustering of the nodes of the original graph, which usually comes from a sparse stochastic block model of Bordenave and Decelle.</description>

Abstract: We use a recent result of Bader and Sauer on coboundary expansion to prove residually finite three-dimensional Poincar\'e duality groups never have property (T). This implies such groups are never K\"ahler. The argument applies to fundamental groups of (possibly non-aspherical) compact 3-manifolds, giving a new proof of a theorem of Fujiwara that states if the fundamental group of a compact 3-manifold has property (T), then that group is finite. The only consequence of geometrization needed in the proof is that 3-manifold groups are residually finite.</description>

      <title>From Complex--Analytic Models to Dyadic Methods: A Real--Variable Approach to Hypersingular Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24972v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on the hypersingular Bergman projection, we develop a real-variable, dyadic framework for hypersingular operators in regimes where strong-type bounds fail on the critical line. Our main new input is what we call the Forelli--Rudin method: a dyadic real-variable mechanism, inspired by complex-analytic Forelli--Rudin type arguments, that provides a flexible way to obtain critical-line and endpoint estimates for general hypersingular operators.
  In the unit disc setting with $1&lt;t&lt;3/2$, we obtain a full characterization of the $(p,q)$ mapping theory for the dyadic hypersingular maximal operator $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$, in particular including estimates on the critical line $1/q-1/p=2t-2$ and a weighted endpoint criterion in the radial setting. In addition, we establish a novel two-weight estimate for $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$ in the range $p&gt;q$, valid for any $t&gt;0$. We also prove endpoint estimates for the hypersingular Bergman projection \[ K_{2t}f(z)=\int_{\mathbb D}\frac{f(w)}{(1-z\overline w)^{2t}}\,dA(w), \] with particular emphasis on the weak-type bound at the endpoint $(p,q)=\bigl(\tfrac{1}{3-2t},1\bigr)$. Finally, we introduce a class of hypersingular cousin of sparse operators in $\mathbb R^n$ associated with graded sparse families, quantified by the sparseness $\eta$ and a new structural parameter (the degree) $K_{\mathcal S}$, and we characterize the corresponding strong and weak type regimes in terms of $(n,t,\eta,K_{\mathcal S})$.
  Our real-variable perspective addresses an inquiry raised by Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on developing effective real-analytic tools in the hypersingular regime for both $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$ and $K_{2t}$, and it also provides a new route toward the critical-line analysis of Forelli--Rudin type operators and related hypersingular operators in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we solve an open question formulated in the original paper of twisted skew group codes regarding when a twisted skew group code is checkable. Also, we prove that all ideals of dimension 3 over a twisted group algebra are abelian group codes, generalising another previous result over group algebras. Finally, we prove a bound on the dimension and distance of a twisted group code, as well as when such bound is reached.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-differential operators associated with the gyrator transform on modulation spaces with Shubin-type symbols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of pseudo-differential operators associated with the gyrator transform on modulation spaces. The gyrator transform is a two-dimensional linear canonical transform which can be viewed as a rotation in the time-frequency plane and is closely related to the fractional Fourier transform. Motivated by the global structure of the gyrator kernel, we work with Shubin global symbol classes on $\mathbb{R}^4$. We first recall basic properties of modulation spaces and establish continuity and invertibility of the gyrator transform on these spaces, using its representation as a metaplectic operator. Then we introduce pseudo-differential operators defined via the gyrator transform and a Shubin symbol, and we prove boundedness results on modulation spaces and on gyrator-based modulation-Sobolev spaces. Our work extends and generalises earlier results of Mahato, Arya and Prasad on Schwartz and Sobolev spaces \cite{MahatoGyrator} to the more flexible framework of modulation spaces.</description>

      <title>SG-Hankel Pseudo-Differential Operators on Weighted Gelfand-Shilov Type Spaces and a Numerical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of SG pseudo-differential operators associated with the Hankel transform on a family of weighted Gelfand--Shilov type spaces of radial functions. First, we recall basic properties of the Hankel transform of order $\nu&gt;-1/2$ and define a convenient Gelfand--Shilov type space $W_{\alpha,\beta}$ which is invariant under the Hankel transform and stable under differentiation and multiplication by powers of the radial variable. Then we define the SG--Hankel symbol class $S^{m_1,m_2}_H$ and the corresponding pseudo-differential operator \[ (T_\sigma f)(x)=\int_0^\infty \sigma(x,\lambda)J_\nu(x\lambda)\widehat f_H(\lambda)\,\lambda\,d\lambda. \] We prove that $T_\sigma$ is continuous on $W_{\alpha,\beta}$, and under additional decay assumptions on the symbol, we obtain compactness results between different weighted spaces. Minimal and maximal realisations of $T_\sigma$ in $L^2((0,\infty),x\, dx)$ are studied in detail, and a weak solvability result for the SG--Hankel pseudo-differential equation $T_\sigma f=g$ is derived. Finally, we present a numerical example for a simple SG symbol and a Gaussian input, illustrating the spatial decay predicted by the theory.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties are de Rham $K(\pi,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Esnault-Hai, one has the notion of de Rham $K(\pi,1)$ schemes, defined as follows. Given a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0 and a base point $x \in X (k)$, one can define its differential fundamental group $\pi^{\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$, which comes from the Tannakian duality of the category of coherent integrable connections on $X$. Using the formalism of $\delta$-functors, one can define natural morphisms between the group-scheme cohomology of $\pi^{\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$ and the de Rham cohomology of $X$. One says that $X$ with $x\in X(k)$ is de Rham $K(\pi,1)$ if such morphisms are all isomorphisms. In this article, we first prove that abelian varieties in characteristic $0$ are de Rham $K(\pi,1)$. In the second part of the article, we study the group-scheme cohomology of the abelianization of the differential fundamental group of a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme via its Albanese variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of pseudo-differential operators associated with a fractional Hankel--Bessel transform. Motivated by the classical Hankel transform and the pseudo-differential operators associated with Bessel operators studied by Pathak and Pandey \cite{PathakPandey1995}, we define a fractional variant by inserting a fractional Fourier-type phase into the Hankel kernel. We then introduce global Shubin-type symbol classes adapted to this transform, derive kernel estimates and integral representations, and establish boundedness results on weighted L^{p}-spaces and on fractional Hankel--Sobolev spaces. This provides a new framework parallel to the classical Hankel pseudo-differential calculus, but in a fractional and global setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators with general degenerate coefficients. We prove semiclassical hypocoercivity estimates for a large class of such operators. Then, we manage to prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of some particular degenerate operators in the semiclassical regime, and quantify the spectral gap separating these eigenvalues from the rest of the spectrum. The main ingredient is the construction of sharp Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <title>Pluriclosed 3-folds with vanishing Bismut Ricci form: General theory in the quasi-regular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study compact complex $3$-dimensional non-K\"ahler Bismut Ricci flat pluriclosed Hermitian manifolds (BHE) via their dimensional reduction to a special K\"ahler geometry in complex dimension $2$, recently obtained by Barbaro, Streets and the first and third authors. We show that in the quasi-regular case, the reduced geometry satisfies a 6th order non-linear PDE which has infinite dimensional momentum map interpretation, similar to the much studied K\"ahler metrics of constant scalar curvature (cscK). We use this to associate to the reduced manifold or orbifold Mabuchi and Calabi functionals, as well as to obtain obstructions for the existence of solutions in terms of the authomorphism group, paralleling results by Futaki and Calabi-Lichnerowicz-Matsushima in the cscK case. This is used to characterize the Samelson locally homogeneous BHE geometries in complex dimension 3 as the only non-K\"ahler BHE $3$-folds with $2$-dimensional Bott-Chern $(1,1)$-cohomology group, for which the reduced space is a smooth K\"ahler surface. We also discuss explicit solutions of the PDE on orthotoric K\"ahler orbifold surfaces, extending examples found by Couzens-Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks in the framework of supersymmetric ${\rm AdS}_3 \times Y_7$ type IIB supergravity. Our construction yields infinitely many non-K\"ahler BHE structures on $S^3\times S^3$ and $S^1\times S^2 \times S^3$, which are not locally isometric to a Samelson geometry. These appear to be the first such examples.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Averages of Plancherel Random Partitions: Elliptic Functions, Phase Transitions, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random integer partitions $\lambda$ that follow the Poissonized Plancherel measure of parameter $t^2$. Using Riemann$-$Hilbert techniques, we establish the asymptotics of the multiplicative averages $$Q(t,s)=\mathbb{E} \left[ \prod_{i\geq 1} \left(1+\mathrm{e}^{\eta(\lambda_i-i+\frac{1}{2}-s)}\right)^{-1} \right] $$ for fixed $\eta&gt;0$ in the regime $t\to+\infty$ and $s/t=O(1)$. We compute the large-$t$ expansion of $\log Q(t,xt)$ expressing the rate function $\mathcal{F}(x) = -\lim_{t \to \infty}t^{-2}\log Q(t,xt)$ and the subsequent divergent and oscillatory contributions explicitly in terms of elliptic theta functions. The associated equilibrium measure presents, in general, nontrivial saturated regions and it undergoes two third-order phase transitions of different nature which we describe. Applications of our results include an explicit characterization of tail probabilities of the height function of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth model and of the edge of the positive-temperature discrete Bessel process and asymptotics of radially symmetric solutions to the 2D Toda equation with step-like initial data.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for Rough Fractional Brownian Motion via Operator Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic formulation of stochastic calculus for fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H in (0, 1/2). The approach is based on adjointness between stochastic integration and differentiation in the Cameron-Martin space of the driving process. For Gaussian Volterra processes, we establish a canonical factorization of fluctuations (Id - E) = delta_X Pi_X D_X, where D_X := delta_X^* is the operator-covariant derivative (adjoint of the stochastic integral), delta_X the divergence, and Pi_X the predictable projection. In the rough fractional regime, the factorization yields explicit derivative formulas for cylindrical functionals, controlled expansions of conditional expectations with O(|t-s|^{2H}) remainders, and an intrinsic identification of the Gubinelli derivative as the predictable component Pi_X D_X F. The framework extends to mixed semimartingale-rough processes, providing a unified calculus without requiring iterated integrals or signature constructions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus as Operator Factorization An Operator-Covariant Derivative and Unified Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an operator-theoretic framework underlying classical stochastic calculus, based on a derivation, a divergence operator, and a predictable projection acting on an abstract energy space. Within this setting, centered random variables admit a factorization as the divergence of their projected derivative, yielding a unified representation principle that recovers classical Clark-Ocone formulas under standard representation assumptions.
  Stochastic integrals, Ito-type identities, and quadratic variation appear as coordinate realizations of deterministic operator identities rather than primitive objects. The framework applies uniformly to Gaussian and non-Gaussian drivers possessing the representation property, including Levy processes, and clarifies the structural role of predictable projection in stochastic integration. Extensions and applications are discussed, emphasizing the separation between operator-level identities and their probabilistic representations.</description>

      <title>On the Birkhoff Spectrum for Hyperbolic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of Birkhoff spectra for hyperbolic dynamical systems. Given a H\"older observable \(f\) on a basic set \(\Lambda\), we obtain the following results: First, we characterize when the Birkhoff spectrum of \(f\) is dense in the positive (or negative) real line. Second, we prove that a bounded Birkhoff spectrum forces \(f\) to be cohomologous to zero, which constitutes an extension of Liv\v{s}ic's theorem. Moreover, we show that if the spectrum exhibits an ``arithmetically sparse'' structure, then \(f\) is cohomologous to a constant. \\ \indent We then extend these results to continuous time. For Anosov flows -- including geodesic flows on Anosov manifolds -- we establish analogous density results for Birkhoff integrals over closed orbits. In particular, we generalize a theorem of Dairbekov--Sharafutdinov \cite{Dairbekov} by proving that a bounded (resp.~arithmetically sparse) spectrum forces a smooth function to vanish (resp.~be constant).</description>

      <title>Moving Least Squares without Quasi-Uniformity: A Stochastic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) are closely related nonparametric estimation methods, developed independently in statistics and approximation theory. While statistical LPR analysis focuses on overcoming sampling noise under probabilistic assumptions, the deterministic MLS theory studies smoothness properties and convergence rates with respect to the \textit{fill-distance} (a resolution parameter). Despite this similarity, the deterministic assumptions underlying MLS fail to hold under random sampling. We begin by quantifying the probabilistic behavior of the fill-distance $h_n$ and \textit{separation} $\delta_n$ of an i.i.d. random sample. That is, for a distribution satisfying a mild regularity condition, $h_n\propto n^{-1/d}\log^{1/d} (n)$ and $\delta_n \propto n^{-2/d}$. We then prove that, for MLS of degree $k\!-\!1$, the approximation error associated with a differential operator $Q$ of order $|m|\le k-1$ decays as $h_n^{\,k-|m|}$ up to logarithmic factors, establishing stochastic analogues of the classical MLS estimates. Additionally, We show that the MLS approximant is smooth with high probability. Finally, we apply the stochastic MLS theory to manifold estimation. Assuming that the sampled Manifold is $k$-times smooth, we show that the Hausdorff distance between the true manifold and its MLS reconstruction decays as $h_n^k$, extending the deterministic Manifold-MLS guarantees to random samples. This work provides the first unified stochastic analysis of MLS, demonstrating that -- despite the failure of deterministic sampling assumptions -- the classical convergence and smoothness properties persist under natural probabilistic models</description>

      <title>A sharp criterion and complete classification of global-in-time solutions and finite time blow-up of solutions to a chemotaxis system in supercritical dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in the whole space, \begin{equation}\label{abst:p}\tag{$\star$} \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v),\\ 0 = \Delta v + w,\\ w_t = \Delta w + u \end{cases} \end{equation} with emphasis on supercritical dimensions. In contrast to the classical parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system, where the analysis can be reduced to a single equation, the above system is essentially parabolic-parabolic and does not admit such a reduction. In this paper, we establish a sharp threshold phenomenon separating global-in-time existence from finite time blow-up in terms of scaling-critical Morrey norms of the initial data. In particular, we prove the existence of singular stationary solutions and show that their Morrey norm values serve as the critical thresholds determining the long-time behavior of solutions. Consequently, we identify new critical exponents at which the long-time behavior of solutions changes. This yields a complete classification of the long-time behavior of solutions, providing the first such results for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system \eqref{abst:p} in supercritical dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Integer Linear Programming is not Differentiable &amp; it's not a mere technical problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the differentiability method employed in the paper ``Differentiable Integer Linear Programming'', Geng, et al., 2025 as shown in its theorem 5 is incorrect. Moreover, there already exists some downstream work that inherits the same error. The underlying reason comes from that, though being continuous in expectation, the surrogate loss is discontinuous in almost every realization of the randomness, for the stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>The most concise recurrence formula for the sums of integer powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $n,k \geq 1$, let $S_k(n)$ denote the power sum $1^k +2^k + \cdots + n^k$. In this note, we first recall the minimal recurrence relation connecting $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k-1}(n)$ established by Abramovich (1973). We then discuss an old algorithm to determine the coefficients of the power sum polynomial $S_k(n)$ in terms of the coefficients of $S_{k-1}(n)$ (see, e.g., Bloom (1993) and Owens (1992)). Moreover, we bring to light an explicit relationship between $S_k(n)$ and $S_{k+1}(n)$ put forward by Budin and Cantor (1972). We conclude that these procedures (including the integration formula expressing $S_k(n)$ in terms of $S_{k-1}(n)$) all constitute equivalent methods to determine $S_k(n)$ starting from $S_{k-1}(n)$. In addition, as a by-product, we provide a determinantal formula for the Bernoulli numbers involving the binomial coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted attention due to its orthogonalized first-order updates, and a deeper theoretical understanding of its convergence behavior is essential for guiding practical applications; however, existing convergence guarantees are either coarse or obtained under restrictive analytical settings. In this work, we establish sharper convergence guarantees for the Muon optimizer through a direct and simplified analysis that does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the update rule. Our results improve upon existing bounds by achieving faster convergence rates while covering a broader class of problem settings. These findings provide a more accurate theoretical characterization of Muon and offer insights applicable to a broader class of orthogonalized first-order methods.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Randomized Subspace Normalized SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized subspace methods reduce per-iteration cost; however, in nonconvex optimization, most analyses are expectation-based, and high-probability bounds remain scarce even under sub-Gaussian noise. We first prove that randomized subspace SGD (RS-SGD) admits a high-probability convergence bound under sub-Gaussian noise, achieving the same order of oracle complexity as prior in-expectation results. Motivated by the prevalence of heavy-tailed gradients in modern machine learning, we then propose randomized subspace normalized SGD (RS-NSGD), which integrates direction normalization into subspace updates. Assuming the noise has bounded $p$-th moments, we establish both in-expectation and high-probability convergence guarantees, and show that RS-NSGD can achieve better oracle complexity than full-dimensional normalized SGD.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new variant of variable-length source coding for sending a source over two parallel channels, one of which is costly and the other free. We give a complete solution to this problem. Next, we relate the problem to the number partitioning problem, which is the task of dividing a given list of numbers into a pre-specified number of subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is as nearly equal as possible. We introduce two new objective functions for this problem and show that an adapted version of the Huffman coding algorithm (with a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for input size $n$) produces the optimal solution for one objective function, and a nearly optimal solution for the other objective function.</description>

      <title>Divergence Results and Convergence of a Variance Reduced Version of ADAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms using exponential moving averages of the past gradients, such as ADAM, RMSProp and AdaGrad, have been having great successes in many applications, especially in training deep neural networks. ADAM in particular stands out as efficient and robust. Despite of its outstanding performance, ADAM has been proved to be divergent for some specific problems. We revisit the divergent question and provide divergent examples under stronger conditions such as in expectation or high probability. Under a variance reduction assumption, we show that an ADAM-type algorithm converges, which means that it is the variance of gradients that causes the divergence of original ADAM. To this end, we propose a variance reduced version of ADAM and provide a convergent analysis of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm has as good performance as ADAM. Our work suggests a new direction for fixing the convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation property of Banach space-valued random feature models including random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Banach space-valued extension of random feature learning, a data-driven supervised machine learning technique for large-scale kernel approximation. By randomly initializing the feature maps, only the linear readout needs to be trained, which reduces the computational complexity substantially. Viewing random feature models as Banach space-valued random variables, we prove a universal approximation result in the corresponding Bochner space. Moreover, we derive approximation rates and an explicit algorithm to learn an element of the given Banach space by such models. The framework of this paper includes random trigonometric/Fourier regression and in particular random neural networks which are single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly initialized, whence only the linear readout needs to be trained. For the latter, we can then lift the universal approximation property of deterministic neural networks to random neural networks, even within function spaces over non-compact domains, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. In addition, we analyze when the training costs for approximating a given function grow polynomially in both the input/output dimension and the reciprocal of a pre-specified tolerated approximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a numerical example the empirical advantages of random feature models over their deterministic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Safety and Speed: A Human-Algorithm Approach to Enhance the FDA's Medical Device Clearance Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) 510(k) pathway allows manufacturers to gain medical device approval by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a legally marketed device. However, the inherent ambiguity of this regulatory procedure has been associated with high recall among many devices cleared through this pathway, raising significant safety concerns. In this paper, we develop a combined human-algorithm approach to assist the FDA in improving its 510(k) medical device clearance process by reducing recall risk and regulatory workload. We first develop machine learning methods to estimate the risk of recall of 510(k) medical devices based on the information available at the time of submission. We then propose a data-driven clearance policy that recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral to FDA's committees for in-depth evaluation. We conduct an empirical study using a unique dataset of over 31,000 submissions that we assembled based on data sources from the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS). Compared to the FDA's current practice, which has a recall rate of 10.3% and a normalized workload measure of 100%, a conservative evaluation of our policy shows a 32.9% improvement in the recall rate and a 40.5% reduction in the workload. Our analyses further suggest annual cost savings of approximately $1.7 billion for the healthcare system driven by avoided replacement costs, which is equivalent to 1.1% of the entire United States annual medical device expenditure. Our findings highlight the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to improve the FDA's current 510(k) pathway.</description>

      <title>Neural Window Decoder for SC-LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural window decoder (NWD) for spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes. The proposed NWD retains the conventional window decoder (WD) process but incorporates trainable neural weights. To train the weights of NWD, we introduce two novel training strategies. First, we restrict the loss function to target variable nodes (VNs) of the window, which prunes the neural network and accordingly enhances training efficiency. Second, we employ the active learning technique with a normalized loss term to prevent the training process from biasing toward specific training regions. Next, we develop a systematic method to derive non-uniform schedules for the NWD based on the training results. We introduce trainable damping factors that reflect the relative importance of check node (CN) updates. By skipping updates with less importance, we can omit $\mathbf{41\%}$ of CN updates without performance degradation compared to the conventional WD. Lastly, we address the error propagation problem inherent in SC-LDPC codes by deploying a complementary weight set, which is activated when an error is detected in the previous window. This adaptive decoding strategy effectively mitigates error propagation without requiring modifications to the code and decoder structures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

Abstract: We describe an efficient, fully fault-tolerant implementation of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) in the 3D cluster state. The two key novelties are (i) the introduction of a lattice defect in the underlying cluster state and (ii) the use of the Rudolph-Grover rebit encoding. Concretely, (i) allows for a topological implementation of the Hadamard gate, while (ii) does the same for the phase gate. Furthermore, we develop general ideas towards circuit compaction and algorithmic circuit verification, which we implement for the Reed-Muller code used for magic state distillation. Our performance analysis highlights the overall improvements provided by the new methods.</description>

      <title>Comparing regularisation paths of (conjugate) gradient estimators in ridge regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider standard gradient descent, gradient flow and conjugate gradients as iterative algorithms for minimising a penalised ridge criterion in linear regression. While it is well known that conjugate gradients exhibit fast numerical convergence, the statistical properties of their iterates are more difficult to assess due to inherent non-linearities and dependencies. On the other hand, standard gradient flow is a linear method with well-known regularising properties when stopped early. By an explicit non-standard error decomposition we are able to bound the prediction error for conjugate gradient iterates by a corresponding prediction error of gradient flow at transformed iteration indices. This way, the risk along the entire regularisation path of conjugate gradient iterations can be compared to that for regularisation paths of standard linear methods like gradient flow and ridge regression. In particular, the oracle conjugate gradient iterate shares the optimality properties of the gradient flow and ridge regression oracles up to a constant factor. Numerical examples show the similarity of the regularisation paths in practice.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. While we confirm all details of the existing literature, we highlight a potentially important point which may provide a better understanding of and insights on the quantization of gauged systems. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as ``sandwich conditions'': The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and the implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space Bandit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. Indeed, in many natural situations, while the nominal set of actions may be large, there also exist significant correlations between the rewards of different actions. In this paper we propose an algorithm that can significantly reduce the action space when such correlations are present, without the need to a-priori know the correlation structure. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the algorithm and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through empirical comparisons with Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum accessible information and classical entropy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the recently obtained optimality criterion (A.S. Holevo, Lobachevskii J. Math., \textbf{43}:7 (2022), 1646-1650), when applied to specific ensembles of states leads to nontrivial tight entropy inequalities that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) (B.-G. Englert and J. \v{R}eh\'{a}\v{c}ek, J. Mod. Optics \textbf{57 }N3 (2010) 218-226) is reconsidered and the corresponding entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also an approach to the proof of the conjectures concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids.</description>

      <title>POLAR: A Pessimistic Model-based Policy Learning Algorithm for Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare, education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training performance or provide guarantees only for an oracle policy, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Cellular, Cell-less, and Everything in Between: A Unified Framework for Utility Region Analysis in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless networks, with a focus on signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into interference patterns of modern network architectures, including extremely large MIMO and cell-less networks. A central contribution is a simple characterization of feasible utility regions using the concept of spectral radius of nonlinear mappings. This characterization provides a powerful mathematical tool for wireless system design and analysis. For example, it allows us to generalize existing characterizations of the weak Pareto boundary using compact notation. It also allows us to derive tractable sufficient conditions for the identification of convex utility regions. This property is particularly important because, on the weak Pareto boundary, it guarantees that time sharing (or user grouping) cannot simultaneously improve the utilities of all users. Beyond geometrical insights, these sufficient conditions have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate maximization problems that are inherently convex, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide justification for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the beamforming strategy.</description>

      <title>Applying the Spectral Method for Modeling Linear Filters: Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new technique for computer modeling linear filters based on the spectral form of mathematical description of linear systems. It assumes the representation of input and output signals of the filter as orthogonal expansions, while filters themselves are described by two-dimensional non-stationary transfer functions. This technique allows one to model the output signal in continuous time, and it is successfully tested on the Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters with different orders.</description>

      <title>Delayed Momentum Aggregation: Communication-efficient Byzantine-robust Federated Learning with Partial Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial participation is essential for communication-efficient federated learning at scale, yet existing Byzantine-robust methods typically assume full client participation. In the partial participation setting, a majority of the sampled clients may be Byzantine, once Byzantine clients dominate, existing methods break down immediately. We introduce delayed momentum aggregation, a principle where the central server aggregates cached momentum from non-sampled clients along with fresh momentum from sampled clients. This principle ensures Byzantine clients remain a minority from the server's perspective even when they dominate the sampled set. We instantiate this principle in our optimizer DeMoA. We analyze the convergence rate of DeMoA, showing that DeMoA is Byzantine-robust under partial participation. Experiments show that, with 20% Byzantine ratio and only 10% partial participation rate, DeMoA achieves the best accuracy even when existing methods fail empirically.</description>

      <title>Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Sensitive Minimax Rates for Spectral Algorithms with Learned Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stability at One Loop for BPS Membranes in a Lorentz-Covariant RVPD Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first rigorous one-loop proof of quantum stability for BPS membranes in the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD). Exploiting the closure of restricted $\kappa$-symmetry with RVPD ensures that the BRST complex terminates without an infinite ghost tower, keeping the gauge-fixed measure analytically controllable.
  Our main result establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes remain stable, while the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode.
  Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero-modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies relations to BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for RVPD-based extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based power control algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics in the Lazy Training Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime. We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function, SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression setting.</description>

      <title>On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Online Price Competition under Generalized Linear Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10718v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $\lambda_i(\mathbf{p}) = \mu_i(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $\mu_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.</description>

      <title>What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.</description>

      <title>Increasing Data Rate through Shaping on Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of cellular systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling with low-density parity check (LDPC) coding for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system. We focus on improving performance of wireless transmission with rate $3/4$ LDPC codes employing $4$-QAM at the cell edge. We double the size of the $4$-QAM constellation by introducing a second shell of signal points, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects the high energy shell less frequently than the low energy shell. We emphasize that the shaping code is also used to transmit information. We employ rate $1/2$ LDPC coding and select the rate of the shaping code to match that of rate $3/4$ LDPC coding using $4$-QAM. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. Our results suggest that it is better to increase rate at the cell edge by introducing shaping, rather than by increasing the rate of the LDPC code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with differentiable resampling in the context of sequential Monte Carlo (e.g., particle filtering). We propose a new informative resampling method that is instantly differentiable, based on an ensemble score diffusion model. We theoretically prove that our diffusion resampling method provides a consistent resampling distribution, and we show empirically that it outperforms the state-of-the-art differentiable resampling methods on multiple filtering and parameter estimation benchmarks. Finally, we show that it achieves competitive end-to-end performance when used in learning a complex dynamics-decoder model with high-dimensional image observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Birkhoff theorems and 2+2 direct pruduct spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling through Koopman Spectral Analysis: An Operator-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD), a particle-based generative modeling framework that learns the Langevin generator via Koopman theory and integrates it with Wasserstein gradient descent. Our key insight is that this spectral structure of the underlying distribution can be directly estimated from trajectory data via the Koopman operator, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential. Additionally, we prove that KSWGD maintains an approximately constant dissipation rate, thereby establishing linear convergence and overcoming the vanishing-gradient phenomenon that hinders existing kernel-based particle methods. We further provide a Feynman--Kac interpretation that clarifies the method's probabilistic foundation. Experiments on compact manifolds, metastable multi-well systems, and high-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations demonstrate that KSWGD consistently outperforms baselines in both convergence speed and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>

Abstract: An r-partite graph is an interval r-graph if corresponding to each vertex we can assign an interval of the real line such that two vertices u and v of different partite sets are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals intersect. In this paper, we provide two vertex-ordering characterizations of interval r-graphs and identify forbidden patterns for interval r-graphs in terms of specific orderings of their vertices.</description>

      <title>On the Provable Suboptimality of Momentum SGD in Nonstationary Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak Heavy-Ball and Nesterov) for tracking time-varying optima under strong convexity and smoothness. Our finite-time bounds reveal a sharp decomposition of tracking error into transient, noise-induced, and drift-induced components. This decomposition exposes a fundamental trade-off: while momentum is often used as a gradient-smoothing heuristic, under distribution shift it incurs an explicit drift-amplification penalty that diverges as the momentum parameter $\beta$ approaches 1, yielding systematic tracking lag. We complement these upper bounds with minimax lower bounds under gradient-variation constraints, proving this momentum-induced tracking penalty is not an analytical artifact but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum is unavoidably worse because stale-gradient averaging forces systematic lag. Our results provide theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic settings and precisely delineate regime boundaries where vanilla SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.</description>

      <title>On the stability, complexity, and distribution of similarity classes of the longest edge bisection process for triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Longest Edge Bisection of a triangle is performed by joining the midpoint of its longest edge to the opposite vertex. Applying this procedure iteratively produces an infinite family of triangles. Surprisingly, a classical result of Stynes (1980) shows that for any initial triangle, this infinite family falls into finitely many similarity classes.
  While the set of classes is finite, it turns out that a far smaller, stable subset of ``fat'' triangles effectively dominates the final mesh structure. We prove the following asymptotic area distribution result: for every initial triangle, the portion of area occupied by terminal quadruples tends to one, with the convergence occurring at an exponential rate. In fact, we provide the precise distribution of triangles in every step. We introduce the {\bf bisection graph} and use spectral methods to establish this result.
  Given this dominance, we provide a complete characterization of triangles possessing a single terminal quadruple, while conversely exhibiting a sequence of triangles with an unbounded number of terminal quadruples. Furthermore, we reveal several fundamental geometric properties of the points of a terminal quadruple, laying the groundwork for studying the geometric distribution of the entire orbit. Our analysis leverages the hyperbolic geometry framework of Perdomo and Plaza (2014) and refines their techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Stationary Diffusions with Stein-type Discrepancies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning a stationary diffusion amounts to estimating the parameters of a stochastic differential equation whose stationary distribution matches a target distribution. We build on the recently introduced kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS), which enforces stationarity by evaluating expectations of the diffusion's generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Leveraging the connection between KDS and Stein discrepancies, we introduce the Stein-type KDS (SKDS) as an alternative formulation. We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $\epsilon$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Output Feedback Stabilization via Policy Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.</description>
